When shall we three meet again	78fsbj33f
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?	78fsbj33f
When the hurlyburly's done,	78fsbj33f
When the battle's lost and won.	78fsbj33f
That will be ere the set of sun.	78fsbj33f
Where the place?	78fsbj33f
Upon the heath.	78fsbj33f
There to meet with Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
I come, Graymalkin!	78fsbj33f
Paddock calls.	78fsbj33f
Anon.	78fsbj33f
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:	78fsbj33f
Hover through the fog and filthy air.	78fsbj33f
What bloody man is that? He can report,	78fsbj33f
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt	78fsbj33f
The newest state.	78fsbj33f
This is the sergeant	78fsbj33f
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought	78fsbj33f
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!	78fsbj33f
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil	78fsbj33f
As thou didst leave it.	78fsbj33f
Doubtful it stood;	78fsbj33f
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together	78fsbj33f
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--	78fsbj33f
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that	78fsbj33f
The multiplying villanies of nature	78fsbj33f
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles	78fsbj33f
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;	78fsbj33f
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,	78fsbj33f
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:	78fsbj33f
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--	78fsbj33f
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,	78fsbj33f
Which smoked with bloody execution,	78fsbj33f
Like valour's minion carved out his passage	78fsbj33f
Till he faced the slave;	78fsbj33f
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,	78fsbj33f
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,	78fsbj33f
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.	78fsbj33f
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!	78fsbj33f
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection	78fsbj33f
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,	78fsbj33f
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come	78fsbj33f
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:	78fsbj33f
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd	78fsbj33f
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,	78fsbj33f
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,	78fsbj33f
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men	78fsbj33f
Began a fresh assault.	78fsbj33f
Dismay'd not this	78fsbj33f
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?	78fsbj33f
Yes;	78fsbj33f
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.	78fsbj33f
If I say sooth, I must report they were	78fsbj33f
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they	78fsbj33f
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:	78fsbj33f
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,	78fsbj33f
Or memorise another Golgotha,	78fsbj33f
I cannot tell.	78fsbj33f
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.	78fsbj33f
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;	78fsbj33f
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.	78fsbj33f
Who comes here?	78fsbj33f
The worthy thane of Ross.	78fsbj33f
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look	78fsbj33f
That seems to speak things strange.	78fsbj33f
God save the king!	78fsbj33f
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?	78fsbj33f
From Fife, great king;	78fsbj33f
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky	78fsbj33f
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,	78fsbj33f
With terrible numbers,	78fsbj33f
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor	78fsbj33f
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;	78fsbj33f
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,	78fsbj33f
Confronted him with self-comparisons,	78fsbj33f
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.	78fsbj33f
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,	78fsbj33f
The victory fell on us.	78fsbj33f
Great happiness!	78fsbj33f
That now	78fsbj33f
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:	78fsbj33f
Nor would we deign him burial of his men	78fsbj33f
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch	78fsbj33f
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.	78fsbj33f
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive	78fsbj33f
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,	78fsbj33f
And with his former title greet Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
I'll see it done.	78fsbj33f
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.	78fsbj33f
Where hast thou been, sister?	78fsbj33f
Killing swine.	78fsbj33f
Sister, where thou?	78fsbj33f
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,	78fsbj33f
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--	78fsbj33f
'Give me,' quoth I:	78fsbj33f
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.	78fsbj33f
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:	78fsbj33f
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,	78fsbj33f
And, like a rat without a tail,	78fsbj33f
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.	78fsbj33f
I'll give thee a wind.	78fsbj33f
Thou'rt kind.	78fsbj33f
And I another.	78fsbj33f
I myself have all the other,	78fsbj33f
And the very ports they blow,	78fsbj33f
All the quarters that they know	78fsbj33f
I' the shipman's card.	78fsbj33f
I will drain him dry as hay:	78fsbj33f
Sleep shall neither night nor day	78fsbj33f
Hang upon his pent-house lid;	78fsbj33f
He shall live a man forbid:	78fsbj33f
Weary se'nnights nine times nine	78fsbj33f
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:	78fsbj33f
Though his bark cannot be lost,	78fsbj33f
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.	78fsbj33f
Look what I have.	78fsbj33f
Show me, show me.	78fsbj33f
Here I have a pilot's thumb,	78fsbj33f
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.	78fsbj33f
A drum, a drum!	78fsbj33f
Macbeth doth come.	78fsbj33f
The weird sisters, hand in hand,	78fsbj33f
Posters of the sea and land,	78fsbj33f
Thus do go about, about:	78fsbj33f
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine	78fsbj33f
And thrice again, to make up nine.	78fsbj33f
Peace! the charm's wound up.	78fsbj33f
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.	78fsbj33f
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these	78fsbj33f
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,	78fsbj33f
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,	78fsbj33f
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught	78fsbj33f
That man may question? You seem to understand me,	78fsbj33f
By each at once her chappy finger laying	78fsbj33f
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,	78fsbj33f
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret	78fsbj33f
That you are so.	78fsbj33f
Speak, if you can: what are you?	78fsbj33f
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!	78fsbj33f
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!	78fsbj33f
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!	78fsbj33f
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear	78fsbj33f
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,	78fsbj33f
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed	78fsbj33f
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner	78fsbj33f
You greet with present grace and great prediction	78fsbj33f
Of noble having and of royal hope,	78fsbj33f
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.	78fsbj33f
If you can look into the seeds of time,	78fsbj33f
And say which grain will grow and which will not,	78fsbj33f
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear	78fsbj33f
Your favours nor your hate.	78fsbj33f
Hail!	78fsbj33f
Hail!	78fsbj33f
Hail!	78fsbj33f
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.	78fsbj33f
Not so happy, yet much happier.	78fsbj33f
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:	78fsbj33f
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!	78fsbj33f
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!	78fsbj33f
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:	78fsbj33f
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;	78fsbj33f
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,	78fsbj33f
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king	78fsbj33f
Stands not within the prospect of belief,	78fsbj33f
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence	78fsbj33f
You owe this strange intelligence? or why	78fsbj33f
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way	78fsbj33f
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.	78fsbj33f
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,	78fsbj33f
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?	78fsbj33f
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted	78fsbj33f
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!	78fsbj33f
Were such things here as we do speak about?	78fsbj33f
Or have we eaten on the insane root	78fsbj33f
That takes the reason prisoner?	78fsbj33f
Your children shall be kings.	78fsbj33f
You shall be king.	78fsbj33f
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?	78fsbj33f
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?	78fsbj33f
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,	78fsbj33f
The news of thy success; and when he reads	78fsbj33f
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,	78fsbj33f
His wonders and his praises do contend	78fsbj33f
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,	78fsbj33f
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,	78fsbj33f
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,	78fsbj33f
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,	78fsbj33f
Strange images of death. As thick as hail	78fsbj33f
Came post with post; and every one did bear	78fsbj33f
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,	78fsbj33f
And pour'd them down before him.	78fsbj33f
We are sent	78fsbj33f
To give thee from our royal master thanks;	78fsbj33f
Only to herald thee into his sight,	78fsbj33f
Not pay thee.	78fsbj33f
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,	78fsbj33f
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:	78fsbj33f
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!	78fsbj33f
For it is thine.	78fsbj33f
What, can the devil speak true?	78fsbj33f
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me	78fsbj33f
In borrow'd robes?	78fsbj33f
Who was the thane lives yet;	78fsbj33f
But under heavy judgment bears that life	78fsbj33f
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined	78fsbj33f
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel	78fsbj33f
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both	78fsbj33f
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;	78fsbj33f
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,	78fsbj33f
Have overthrown him.	78fsbj33f
[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!	78fsbj33f
The greatest is behind.	78fsbj33f
Thanks for your pains.	78fsbj33f
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,	78fsbj33f
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me	78fsbj33f
Promised no less to them?	78fsbj33f
That trusted home	78fsbj33f
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,	78fsbj33f
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:	78fsbj33f
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,	78fsbj33f
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,	78fsbj33f
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's	78fsbj33f
In deepest consequence.	78fsbj33f
Cousins, a word, I pray you.	78fsbj33f
[Aside] Two truths are told,	78fsbj33f
As happy prologues to the swelling act	78fsbj33f
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.	78fsbj33f
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,	78fsbj33f
Why hath it given me earnest of success,	78fsbj33f
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:	78fsbj33f
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion	78fsbj33f
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair	78fsbj33f
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,	78fsbj33f
Against the use of nature? Present fears	78fsbj33f
Are less than horrible imaginings:	78fsbj33f
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,	78fsbj33f
Shakes so my single state of man that function	78fsbj33f
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is	78fsbj33f
But what is not.	78fsbj33f
Look, how our partner's rapt.	78fsbj33f
[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,	78fsbj33f
Without my stir.	78fsbj33f
New horrors come upon him,	78fsbj33f
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould	78fsbj33f
But with the aid of use.	78fsbj33f
[Aside]       Come what come may,	78fsbj33f
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.	78fsbj33f
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	78fsbj33f
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought	78fsbj33f
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains	78fsbj33f
Are register'd where every day I turn	78fsbj33f
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.	78fsbj33f
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,	78fsbj33f
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak	78fsbj33f
Our free hearts each to other.	78fsbj33f
Very gladly.	78fsbj33f
Till then, enough. Come, friends.	78fsbj33f
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not	78fsbj33f
Those in commission yet return'd?	78fsbj33f
My liege,	78fsbj33f
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke	78fsbj33f
With one that saw him die: who did report	78fsbj33f
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,	78fsbj33f
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth	78fsbj33f
A deep repentance: nothing in his life	78fsbj33f
Became him like the leaving it; he died	78fsbj33f
As one that had been studied in his death	78fsbj33f
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,	78fsbj33f
As 'twere a careless trifle.	78fsbj33f
There's no art	78fsbj33f
To find the mind's construction in the face:	78fsbj33f
He was a gentleman on whom I built	78fsbj33f
An absolute trust.	78fsbj33f
O worthiest cousin!	78fsbj33f
The sin of my ingratitude even now	78fsbj33f
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before	78fsbj33f
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow	78fsbj33f
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,	78fsbj33f
That the proportion both of thanks and payment	78fsbj33f
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,	78fsbj33f
More is thy due than more than all can pay.	78fsbj33f
The service and the loyalty I owe,	78fsbj33f
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part	78fsbj33f
Is to receive our duties; and our duties	78fsbj33f
Are to your throne and state children and servants,	78fsbj33f
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing	78fsbj33f
Safe toward your love and honour.	78fsbj33f
Welcome hither:	78fsbj33f
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour	78fsbj33f
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,	78fsbj33f
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known	78fsbj33f
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee	78fsbj33f
And hold thee to my heart.	78fsbj33f
There if I grow,	78fsbj33f
The harvest is your own.	78fsbj33f
My plenteous joys,	78fsbj33f
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves	78fsbj33f
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,	78fsbj33f
And you whose places are the nearest, know	78fsbj33f
We will establish our estate upon	78fsbj33f
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter	78fsbj33f
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must	78fsbj33f
Not unaccompanied invest him only,	78fsbj33f
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine	78fsbj33f
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,	78fsbj33f
And bind us further to you.	78fsbj33f
The rest is labour, which is not used for you:	78fsbj33f
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful	78fsbj33f
The hearing of my wife with your approach;	78fsbj33f
So humbly take my leave.	78fsbj33f
My worthy Cawdor!	78fsbj33f
[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step	78fsbj33f
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,	78fsbj33f
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;	78fsbj33f
Let not light see my black and deep desires:	78fsbj33f
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,	78fsbj33f
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.	78fsbj33f
True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,	78fsbj33f
And in his commendations I am fed;	78fsbj33f
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,	78fsbj33f
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:	78fsbj33f
It is a peerless kinsman.	78fsbj33f
'They met me in the day of success: and I have	78fsbj33f
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in	78fsbj33f
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire	78fsbj33f
to question them further, they made themselves air,	78fsbj33f
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in	78fsbj33f
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who	78fsbj33f
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,	78fsbj33f
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred	78fsbj33f
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that	78fsbj33f
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver	78fsbj33f
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou	78fsbj33f
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being	78fsbj33f
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it	78fsbj33f
to thy heart, and farewell.'	78fsbj33f
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be	78fsbj33f
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;	78fsbj33f
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness	78fsbj33f
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;	78fsbj33f
Art not without ambition, but without	78fsbj33f
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,	78fsbj33f
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,	78fsbj33f
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,	78fsbj33f
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;	78fsbj33f
And that which rather thou dost fear to do	78fsbj33f
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,	78fsbj33f
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;	78fsbj33f
And chastise with the valour of my tongue	78fsbj33f
All that impedes thee from the golden round,	78fsbj33f
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem	78fsbj33f
To have thee crown'd withal.	78fsbj33f
What is your tidings?	78fsbj33f
The king comes here to-night.	78fsbj33f
Thou'rt mad to say it:	78fsbj33f
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,	78fsbj33f
Would have inform'd for preparation.	78fsbj33f
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:	78fsbj33f
One of my fellows had the speed of him,	78fsbj33f
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more	78fsbj33f
Than would make up his message.	78fsbj33f
Give him tending;	78fsbj33f
He brings great news.	78fsbj33f
The raven himself is hoarse	78fsbj33f
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan	78fsbj33f
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits	78fsbj33f
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,	78fsbj33f
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full	78fsbj33f
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;	78fsbj33f
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,	78fsbj33f
That no compunctious visitings of nature	78fsbj33f
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between	78fsbj33f
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,	78fsbj33f
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,	78fsbj33f
Wherever in your sightless substances	78fsbj33f
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,	78fsbj33f
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,	78fsbj33f
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,	78fsbj33f
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,	78fsbj33f
To cry 'Hold, hold!'	78fsbj33f
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!	78fsbj33f
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!	78fsbj33f
Thy letters have transported me beyond	78fsbj33f
This ignorant present, and I feel now	78fsbj33f
The future in the instant.	78fsbj33f
My dearest love,	78fsbj33f
Duncan comes here to-night.	78fsbj33f
And when goes hence?	78fsbj33f
To-morrow, as he purposes.	78fsbj33f
O, never	78fsbj33f
Shall sun that morrow see!	78fsbj33f
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men	78fsbj33f
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,	78fsbj33f
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,	78fsbj33f
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,	78fsbj33f
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming	78fsbj33f
Must be provided for: and you shall put	78fsbj33f
This night's great business into my dispatch;	78fsbj33f
Which shall to all our nights and days to come	78fsbj33f
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.	78fsbj33f
We will speak further.	78fsbj33f
Only look up clear;	78fsbj33f
To alter favour ever is to fear:	78fsbj33f
Leave all the rest to me.	78fsbj33f
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air	78fsbj33f
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself	78fsbj33f
Unto our gentle senses.	78fsbj33f
This guest of summer,	78fsbj33f
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,	78fsbj33f
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath	78fsbj33f
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,	78fsbj33f
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird	78fsbj33f
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:	78fsbj33f
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,	78fsbj33f
The air is delicate.	78fsbj33f
See, see, our honour'd hostess!	78fsbj33f
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,	78fsbj33f
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you	78fsbj33f
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,	78fsbj33f
And thank us for your trouble.	78fsbj33f
All our service	78fsbj33f
In every point twice done and then done double	78fsbj33f
Were poor and single business to contend	78fsbj33f
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith	78fsbj33f
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,	78fsbj33f
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,	78fsbj33f
We rest your hermits.	78fsbj33f
Where's the thane of Cawdor?	78fsbj33f
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose	78fsbj33f
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;	78fsbj33f
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him	78fsbj33f
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,	78fsbj33f
We are your guest to-night.	78fsbj33f
Your servants ever	78fsbj33f
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,	78fsbj33f
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,	78fsbj33f
Still to return your own.	78fsbj33f
Give me your hand;	78fsbj33f
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,	78fsbj33f
And shall continue our graces towards him.	78fsbj33f
By your leave, hostess.	78fsbj33f
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well	78fsbj33f
It were done quickly: if the assassination	78fsbj33f
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch	78fsbj33f
With his surcease success; that but this blow	78fsbj33f
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,	78fsbj33f
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,	78fsbj33f
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases	78fsbj33f
We still have judgment here; that we but teach	78fsbj33f
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return	78fsbj33f
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice	78fsbj33f
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice	78fsbj33f
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;	78fsbj33f
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,	78fsbj33f
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,	78fsbj33f
Who should against his murderer shut the door,	78fsbj33f
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan	78fsbj33f
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been	78fsbj33f
So clear in his great office, that his virtues	78fsbj33f
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against	78fsbj33f
The deep damnation of his taking-off;	78fsbj33f
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,	78fsbj33f
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed	78fsbj33f
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,	78fsbj33f
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,	78fsbj33f
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur	78fsbj33f
To prick the sides of my intent, but only	78fsbj33f
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself	78fsbj33f
And falls on the other.	78fsbj33f
How now! what news?	78fsbj33f
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?	78fsbj33f
Hath he ask'd for me?	78fsbj33f
Know you not he has?	78fsbj33f
We will proceed no further in this business:	78fsbj33f
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought	78fsbj33f
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,	78fsbj33f
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,	78fsbj33f
Not cast aside so soon.	78fsbj33f
Was the hope drunk	78fsbj33f
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?	78fsbj33f
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale	78fsbj33f
At what it did so freely? From this time	78fsbj33f
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard	78fsbj33f
To be the same in thine own act and valour	78fsbj33f
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that	78fsbj33f
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,	78fsbj33f
And live a coward in thine own esteem,	78fsbj33f
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'	78fsbj33f
Like the poor cat i' the adage?	78fsbj33f
Prithee, peace:	78fsbj33f
I dare do all that may become a man;	78fsbj33f
Who dares do more is none.	78fsbj33f
What beast was't, then,	78fsbj33f
That made you break this enterprise to me?	78fsbj33f
When you durst do it, then you were a man;	78fsbj33f
And, to be more than what you were, you would	78fsbj33f
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place	78fsbj33f
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:	78fsbj33f
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now	78fsbj33f
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know	78fsbj33f
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:	78fsbj33f
I would, while it was smiling in my face,	78fsbj33f
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,	78fsbj33f
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you	78fsbj33f
Have done to this.	78fsbj33f
If we should fail?	78fsbj33f
We fail!	78fsbj33f
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,	78fsbj33f
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--	78fsbj33f
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey	78fsbj33f
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains	78fsbj33f
Will I with wine and wassail so convince	78fsbj33f
That memory, the warder of the brain,	78fsbj33f
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason	78fsbj33f
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep	78fsbj33f
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,	78fsbj33f
What cannot you and I perform upon	78fsbj33f
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon	78fsbj33f
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt	78fsbj33f
Of our great quell?	78fsbj33f
Bring forth men-children only;	78fsbj33f
For thy undaunted mettle should compose	78fsbj33f
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,	78fsbj33f
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two	78fsbj33f
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,	78fsbj33f
That they have done't?	78fsbj33f
Who dares receive it other,	78fsbj33f
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar	78fsbj33f
Upon his death?	78fsbj33f
I am settled, and bend up	78fsbj33f
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.	78fsbj33f
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:	78fsbj33f
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.	78fsbj33f
How goes the night, boy?	78fsbj33f
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.	78fsbj33f
And she goes down at twelve.	78fsbj33f
I take't, 'tis later, sir.	78fsbj33f
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;	78fsbj33f
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.	78fsbj33f
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,	78fsbj33f
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,	78fsbj33f
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature	78fsbj33f
Gives way to in repose!	78fsbj33f
Give me my sword.	78fsbj33f
Who's there?	78fsbj33f
A friend.	78fsbj33f
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:	78fsbj33f
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and	78fsbj33f
Sent forth great largess to your offices.	78fsbj33f
This diamond he greets your wife withal,	78fsbj33f
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up	78fsbj33f
In measureless content.	78fsbj33f
Being unprepared,	78fsbj33f
Our will became the servant to defect;	78fsbj33f
Which else should free have wrought.	78fsbj33f
All's well.	78fsbj33f
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:	78fsbj33f
To you they have show'd some truth.	78fsbj33f
I think not of them:	78fsbj33f
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,	78fsbj33f
We would spend it in some words upon that business,	78fsbj33f
If you would grant the time.	78fsbj33f
At your kind'st leisure.	78fsbj33f
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,	78fsbj33f
It shall make honour for you.	78fsbj33f
So I lose none	78fsbj33f
In seeking to augment it, but still keep	78fsbj33f
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,	78fsbj33f
I shall be counsell'd.	78fsbj33f
Good repose the while!	78fsbj33f
Thanks, sir: the like to you!	78fsbj33f
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,	78fsbj33f
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.	78fsbj33f
Is this a dagger which I see before me,	78fsbj33f
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.	78fsbj33f
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.	78fsbj33f
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible	78fsbj33f
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but	78fsbj33f
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,	78fsbj33f
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	78fsbj33f
I see thee yet, in form as palpable	78fsbj33f
As this which now I draw.	78fsbj33f
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;	78fsbj33f
And such an instrument I was to use.	78fsbj33f
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,	78fsbj33f
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,	78fsbj33f
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,	78fsbj33f
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:	78fsbj33f
It is the bloody business which informs	78fsbj33f
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld	78fsbj33f
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse	78fsbj33f
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates	78fsbj33f
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,	78fsbj33f
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,	78fsbj33f
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.	78fsbj33f
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design	78fsbj33f
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,	78fsbj33f
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear	78fsbj33f
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	78fsbj33f
And take the present horror from the time,	78fsbj33f
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:	78fsbj33f
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.	78fsbj33f
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.	78fsbj33f
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell	78fsbj33f
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.	78fsbj33f
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;	78fsbj33f
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.	78fsbj33f
Hark! Peace!	78fsbj33f
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,	78fsbj33f
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:	78fsbj33f
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms	78fsbj33f
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd	78fsbj33f
their possets,	78fsbj33f
That death and nature do contend about them,	78fsbj33f
Whether they live or die.	78fsbj33f
[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!	78fsbj33f
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,	78fsbj33f
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed	78fsbj33f
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;	78fsbj33f
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled	78fsbj33f
My father as he slept, I had done't.	78fsbj33f
My husband!	78fsbj33f
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?	78fsbj33f
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.	78fsbj33f
Did not you speak?	78fsbj33f
When?	78fsbj33f
Now.	78fsbj33f
As I descended?	78fsbj33f
Ay.	78fsbj33f
Hark!	78fsbj33f
Who lies i' the second chamber?	78fsbj33f
Donalbain.	78fsbj33f
This is a sorry sight.	78fsbj33f
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.	78fsbj33f
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried	78fsbj33f
'Murder!'	78fsbj33f
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:	78fsbj33f
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them	78fsbj33f
Again to sleep.	78fsbj33f
There are two lodged together.	78fsbj33f
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;	78fsbj33f
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.	78fsbj33f
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'	78fsbj33f
When they did say 'God bless us!'	78fsbj33f
Consider it not so deeply.	78fsbj33f
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?	78fsbj33f
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'	78fsbj33f
Stuck in my throat.	78fsbj33f
These deeds must not be thought	78fsbj33f
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.	78fsbj33f
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!	78fsbj33f
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,	78fsbj33f
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,	78fsbj33f
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,	78fsbj33f
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,	78fsbj33f
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--	78fsbj33f
What do you mean?	78fsbj33f
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:	78fsbj33f
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor	78fsbj33f
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'	78fsbj33f
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,	78fsbj33f
You do unbend your noble strength, to think	78fsbj33f
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,	78fsbj33f
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.	78fsbj33f
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?	78fsbj33f
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear	78fsbj33f
The sleepy grooms with blood.	78fsbj33f
I'll go no more:	78fsbj33f
I am afraid to think what I have done;	78fsbj33f
Look on't again I dare not.	78fsbj33f
Infirm of purpose!	78fsbj33f
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead	78fsbj33f
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood	78fsbj33f
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,	78fsbj33f
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;	78fsbj33f
For it must seem their guilt.	78fsbj33f
Whence is that knocking?	78fsbj33f
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?	78fsbj33f
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.	78fsbj33f
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood	78fsbj33f
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather	78fsbj33f
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,	78fsbj33f
Making the green one red.	78fsbj33f
My hands are of your colour; but I shame	78fsbj33f
To wear a heart so white.	78fsbj33f
I hear a knocking	78fsbj33f
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;	78fsbj33f
A little water clears us of this deed:	78fsbj33f
How easy is it, then! Your constancy	78fsbj33f
Hath left you unattended.	78fsbj33f
Hark! more knocking.	78fsbj33f
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,	78fsbj33f
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost	78fsbj33f
So poorly in your thoughts.	78fsbj33f
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.	78fsbj33f
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!	78fsbj33f
Here's a knocking indeed! If a	78fsbj33f
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have	78fsbj33f
old turning the key.	78fsbj33f
Knock,	78fsbj33f
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of	78fsbj33f
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged	78fsbj33f
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in	78fsbj33f
time; have napkins enow about you; here	78fsbj33f
you'll sweat for't.	78fsbj33f
Knock,	78fsbj33f
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's	78fsbj33f
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could	78fsbj33f
swear in both the scales against either scale;	78fsbj33f
who committed treason enough for God's sake,	78fsbj33f
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come	78fsbj33f
in, equivocator.	78fsbj33f
Knock,	78fsbj33f
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an	78fsbj33f
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of	78fsbj33f
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may	78fsbj33f
roast your goose.	78fsbj33f
Knock,	78fsbj33f
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But	78fsbj33f
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter	78fsbj33f
it no further: I had thought to have let in	78fsbj33f
some of all professions that go the primrose	78fsbj33f
way to the everlasting bonfire.	78fsbj33f
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.	78fsbj33f
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,	78fsbj33f
That you do lie so late?	78fsbj33f
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the	78fsbj33f
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great	78fsbj33f
provoker of three things.	78fsbj33f
What three things does drink especially provoke?	78fsbj33f
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and	78fsbj33f
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;	78fsbj33f
it provokes the desire, but it takes	78fsbj33f
away the performance: therefore, much drink	78fsbj33f
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:	78fsbj33f
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets	78fsbj33f
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,	78fsbj33f
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and	78fsbj33f
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him	78fsbj33f
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.	78fsbj33f
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.	78fsbj33f
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on	78fsbj33f
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I	78fsbj33f
think, being too strong for him, though he took	78fsbj33f
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast	78fsbj33f
him.	78fsbj33f
Is thy master stirring?	78fsbj33f
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.	78fsbj33f
Good morrow, noble sir.	78fsbj33f
Good morrow, both.	78fsbj33f
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?	78fsbj33f
Not yet.	78fsbj33f
He did command me to call timely on him:	78fsbj33f
I have almost slipp'd the hour.	78fsbj33f
I'll bring you to him.	78fsbj33f
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;	78fsbj33f
But yet 'tis one.	78fsbj33f
The labour we delight in physics pain.	78fsbj33f
This is the door.	78fsbj33f
I'll make so bold to call,	78fsbj33f
For 'tis my limited service.	78fsbj33f
Goes the king hence to-day?	78fsbj33f
He does: he did appoint so.	78fsbj33f
The night has been unruly: where we lay,	78fsbj33f
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,	78fsbj33f
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,	78fsbj33f
And prophesying with accents terrible	78fsbj33f
Of dire combustion and confused events	78fsbj33f
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird	78fsbj33f
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth	78fsbj33f
Was feverous and did shake.	78fsbj33f
'Twas a rough night.	78fsbj33f
My young remembrance cannot parallel	78fsbj33f
A fellow to it.	78fsbj33f
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart	78fsbj33f
Cannot conceive nor name thee!	78fsbj33f
What's the matter.	78fsbj33f
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!	78fsbj33f
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope	78fsbj33f
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence	78fsbj33f
The life o' the building!	78fsbj33f
What is 't you say? the life?	78fsbj33f
Mean you his majesty?	78fsbj33f
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight	78fsbj33f
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;	78fsbj33f
See, and then speak yourselves.	78fsbj33f
Awake, awake!	78fsbj33f
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!	78fsbj33f
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!	78fsbj33f
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,	78fsbj33f
And look on death itself! up, up, and see	78fsbj33f
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!	78fsbj33f
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,	78fsbj33f
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.	78fsbj33f
What's the business,	78fsbj33f
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley	78fsbj33f
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!	78fsbj33f
O gentle lady,	78fsbj33f
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:	78fsbj33f
The repetition, in a woman's ear,	78fsbj33f
Would murder as it fell.	78fsbj33f
O Banquo, Banquo,	78fsbj33f
Our royal master 's murder'd!	78fsbj33f
Woe, alas!	78fsbj33f
What, in our house?	78fsbj33f
Too cruel any where.	78fsbj33f
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,	78fsbj33f
And say it is not so.	78fsbj33f
Had I but died an hour before this chance,	78fsbj33f
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,	78fsbj33f
There 's nothing serious in mortality:	78fsbj33f
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;	78fsbj33f
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees	78fsbj33f
Is left this vault to brag of.	78fsbj33f
What is amiss?	78fsbj33f
You are, and do not know't:	78fsbj33f
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood	78fsbj33f
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.	78fsbj33f
Your royal father 's murder'd.	78fsbj33f
O, by whom?	78fsbj33f
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:	78fsbj33f
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;	78fsbj33f
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found	78fsbj33f
Upon their pillows:	78fsbj33f
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life	78fsbj33f
Was to be trusted with them.	78fsbj33f
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,	78fsbj33f
That I did kill them.	78fsbj33f
Wherefore did you so?	78fsbj33f
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,	78fsbj33f
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:	78fsbj33f
The expedition my violent love	78fsbj33f
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,	78fsbj33f
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;	78fsbj33f
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature	78fsbj33f
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,	78fsbj33f
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers	78fsbj33f
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,	78fsbj33f
That had a heart to love, and in that heart	78fsbj33f
Courage to make 's love kno wn?	78fsbj33f
Help me hence, ho!	78fsbj33f
Look to the lady.	78fsbj33f
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,	78fsbj33f
That most may claim this argument for ours?	78fsbj33f
[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,	78fsbj33f
where our fate,	78fsbj33f
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?	78fsbj33f
Let 's away;	78fsbj33f
Our tears are not yet brew'd.	78fsbj33f
[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow	78fsbj33f
Upon the foot of motion.	78fsbj33f
Look to the lady:	78fsbj33f
And when we have our naked frailties hid,	78fsbj33f
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,	78fsbj33f
And question this most bloody piece of work,	78fsbj33f
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:	78fsbj33f
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence	78fsbj33f
Against the undivulged pretence I fight	78fsbj33f
Of treasonous malice.	78fsbj33f
And so do I.	78fsbj33f
So all.	78fsbj33f
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,	78fsbj33f
And meet i' the hall together.	78fsbj33f
Well contented.	78fsbj33f
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:	78fsbj33f
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office	78fsbj33f
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.	78fsbj33f
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune	78fsbj33f
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,	78fsbj33f
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,	78fsbj33f
The nearer bloody.	78fsbj33f
This murderous shaft that's shot	78fsbj33f
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way	78fsbj33f
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;	78fsbj33f
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,	78fsbj33f
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft	78fsbj33f
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.	78fsbj33f
Threescore and ten I can remember well:	78fsbj33f
Within the volume of which time I have seen	78fsbj33f
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night	78fsbj33f
Hath trifled former knowings.	78fsbj33f
Ah, good father,	78fsbj33f
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,	78fsbj33f
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,	78fsbj33f
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:	78fsbj33f
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,	78fsbj33f
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,	78fsbj33f
When living light should kiss it?	78fsbj33f
'Tis unnatural,	78fsbj33f
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,	78fsbj33f
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,	78fsbj33f
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.	78fsbj33f
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--	78fsbj33f
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,	78fsbj33f
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,	78fsbj33f
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make	78fsbj33f
War with mankind.	78fsbj33f
'Tis said they eat each other.	78fsbj33f
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes	78fsbj33f
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.	78fsbj33f
How goes the world, sir, now?	78fsbj33f
Why, see you not?	78fsbj33f
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?	78fsbj33f
Those that Macbeth hath slain.	78fsbj33f
Alas, the day!	78fsbj33f
What good could they pretend?	78fsbj33f
They were suborn'd:	78fsbj33f
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,	78fsbj33f
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them	78fsbj33f
Suspicion of the deed.	78fsbj33f
'Gainst nature still!	78fsbj33f
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up	78fsbj33f
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like	78fsbj33f
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
He is already named, and gone to Scone	78fsbj33f
To be invested.	78fsbj33f
Where is Duncan's body?	78fsbj33f
Carried to Colmekill,	78fsbj33f
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,	78fsbj33f
And guardian of their bones.	78fsbj33f
Will you to Scone?	78fsbj33f
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.	78fsbj33f
Well, I will thither.	78fsbj33f
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!	78fsbj33f
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!	78fsbj33f
Farewell, father.	78fsbj33f
God's benison go with you; and with those	78fsbj33f
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!	78fsbj33f
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,	78fsbj33f
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,	78fsbj33f
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said	78fsbj33f
It should not stand in thy posterity,	78fsbj33f
But that myself should be the root and father	78fsbj33f
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--	78fsbj33f
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--	78fsbj33f
Why, by the verities on thee made good,	78fsbj33f
May they not be my oracles as well,	78fsbj33f
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.	78fsbj33f
Here's our chief guest.	78fsbj33f
If he had been forgotten,	78fsbj33f
It had been as a gap in our great feast,	78fsbj33f
And all-thing unbecoming.	78fsbj33f
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,	78fsbj33f
And I'll request your presence.	78fsbj33f
Let your highness	78fsbj33f
Command upon me; to the which my duties	78fsbj33f
Are with a most indissoluble tie	78fsbj33f
For ever knit.	78fsbj33f
Ride you this afternoon?	78fsbj33f
Ay, my good lord.	78fsbj33f
We should have else desired your good advice,	78fsbj33f
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,	78fsbj33f
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.	78fsbj33f
Is't far you ride?	78fsbj33f
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time	78fsbj33f
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,	78fsbj33f
I must become a borrower of the night	78fsbj33f
For a dark hour or twain.	78fsbj33f
Fail not our feast.	78fsbj33f
My lord, I will not.	78fsbj33f
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd	78fsbj33f
In England and in Ireland, not confessing	78fsbj33f
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers	78fsbj33f
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,	78fsbj33f
When therewithal we shall have cause of state	78fsbj33f
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,	78fsbj33f
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?	78fsbj33f
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.	78fsbj33f
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;	78fsbj33f
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.	78fsbj33f
Let every man be master of his time	78fsbj33f
Till seven at night: to make society	78fsbj33f
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself	78fsbj33f
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!	78fsbj33f
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men	78fsbj33f
Our pleasure?	78fsbj33f
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.	78fsbj33f
Bring them before us.	78fsbj33f
To be thus is nothing;	78fsbj33f
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo	78fsbj33f
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature	78fsbj33f
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;	78fsbj33f
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,	78fsbj33f
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour	78fsbj33f
To act in safety. There is none but he	78fsbj33f
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,	78fsbj33f
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,	78fsbj33f
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters	78fsbj33f
When first they put the name of king upon me,	78fsbj33f
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like	78fsbj33f
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:	78fsbj33f
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,	78fsbj33f
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,	78fsbj33f
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,	78fsbj33f
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,	78fsbj33f
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;	78fsbj33f
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;	78fsbj33f
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace	78fsbj33f
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel	78fsbj33f
Given to the common enemy of man,	78fsbj33f
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!	78fsbj33f
Rather than so, come fate into the list.	78fsbj33f
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!	78fsbj33f
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.	78fsbj33f
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?	78fsbj33f
It was, so please your highness.	78fsbj33f
Well then, now	78fsbj33f
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know	78fsbj33f
That it was he in the times past which held you	78fsbj33f
So under fortune, which you thought had been	78fsbj33f
Our innocent self: this I made good to you	78fsbj33f
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,	78fsbj33f
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,	78fsbj33f
the instruments,	78fsbj33f
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might	78fsbj33f
To half a soul and to a notion crazed	78fsbj33f
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'	78fsbj33f
You made it known to us.	78fsbj33f
I did so, and went further, which is now	78fsbj33f
Our point of second meeting. Do you find	78fsbj33f
Your patience so predominant in your nature	78fsbj33f
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd	78fsbj33f
To pray for this good man and for his issue,	78fsbj33f
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave	78fsbj33f
And beggar'd yours for ever?	78fsbj33f
We are men, my liege.	78fsbj33f
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;	78fsbj33f
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,	78fsbj33f
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept	78fsbj33f
All by the name of dogs: the valued file	78fsbj33f
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,	78fsbj33f
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one	78fsbj33f
According to the gift which bounteous nature	78fsbj33f
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive	78fsbj33f
Particular addition. from the bill	78fsbj33f
That writes them all alike: and so of men.	78fsbj33f
Now, if you have a station in the file,	78fsbj33f
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;	78fsbj33f
And I will put that business in your bosoms,	78fsbj33f
Whose execution takes your enemy off,	78fsbj33f
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,	78fsbj33f
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,	78fsbj33f
Which in his death were perfect.	78fsbj33f
I am one, my liege,	78fsbj33f
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	78fsbj33f
Have so incensed that I am reckless what	78fsbj33f
I do to spite the world.	78fsbj33f
And I another	78fsbj33f
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,	78fsbj33f
That I would set my lie on any chance,	78fsbj33f
To mend it, or be rid on't.	78fsbj33f
Both of you	78fsbj33f
Know Banquo was your enemy.	78fsbj33f
True, my lord.	78fsbj33f
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,	78fsbj33f
That every minute of his being thrusts	78fsbj33f
Against my near'st of life: and though I could	78fsbj33f
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight	78fsbj33f
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,	78fsbj33f
For certain friends that are both his and mine,	78fsbj33f
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall	78fsbj33f
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,	78fsbj33f
That I to your assistance do make love,	78fsbj33f
Masking the business from the common eye	78fsbj33f
For sundry weighty reasons.	78fsbj33f
We shall, my lord,	78fsbj33f
Perform what you command us.	78fsbj33f
Though our lives--	78fsbj33f
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most	78fsbj33f
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;	78fsbj33f
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,	78fsbj33f
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,	78fsbj33f
And something from the palace; always thought	78fsbj33f
That I require a clearness: and with him--	78fsbj33f
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--	78fsbj33f
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,	78fsbj33f
Whose absence is no less material to me	78fsbj33f
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate	78fsbj33f
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:	78fsbj33f
I'll come to you anon.	78fsbj33f
We are resolved, my lord.	78fsbj33f
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.	78fsbj33f
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,	78fsbj33f
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.	78fsbj33f
Is Banquo gone from court?	78fsbj33f
Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.	78fsbj33f
Say to the king, I would attend his leisure	78fsbj33f
For a few words.	78fsbj33f
Madam, I will.	78fsbj33f
Nought's had, all's spent,	78fsbj33f
Where our desire is got without content:	78fsbj33f
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy	78fsbj33f
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.	78fsbj33f
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,	78fsbj33f
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,	78fsbj33f
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died	78fsbj33f
With them they think on? Things without all remedy	78fsbj33f
Should be without regard: what's done is done.	78fsbj33f
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:	78fsbj33f
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice	78fsbj33f
Remains in danger of her former tooth.	78fsbj33f
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the	78fsbj33f
worlds suffer,	78fsbj33f
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep	78fsbj33f
In the affliction of these terrible dreams	78fsbj33f
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,	78fsbj33f
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,	78fsbj33f
Than on the torture of the mind to lie	78fsbj33f
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;	78fsbj33f
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;	78fsbj33f
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,	78fsbj33f
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,	78fsbj33f
Can touch him further.	78fsbj33f
Come on;	78fsbj33f
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;	78fsbj33f
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.	78fsbj33f
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:	78fsbj33f
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;	78fsbj33f
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:	78fsbj33f
Unsafe the while, that we	78fsbj33f
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,	78fsbj33f
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,	78fsbj33f
Disguising what they are.	78fsbj33f
You must leave this.	78fsbj33f
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!	78fsbj33f
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.	78fsbj33f
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.	78fsbj33f
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;	78fsbj33f
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown	78fsbj33f
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons	78fsbj33f
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums	78fsbj33f
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done	78fsbj33f
A deed of dreadful note.	78fsbj33f
What's to be done?	78fsbj33f
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,	78fsbj33f
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,	78fsbj33f
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;	78fsbj33f
And with thy bloody and invisible hand	78fsbj33f
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond	78fsbj33f
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow	78fsbj33f
Makes wing to the rooky wood:	78fsbj33f
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;	78fsbj33f
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.	78fsbj33f
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;	78fsbj33f
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.	78fsbj33f
So, prithee, go with me.	78fsbj33f
But who did bid thee join with us?	78fsbj33f
Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers	78fsbj33f
Our offices and what we have to do	78fsbj33f
To the direction just.	78fsbj33f
Then stand with us.	78fsbj33f
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:	78fsbj33f
Now spurs the lated traveller apace	78fsbj33f
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches	78fsbj33f
The subject of our watch.	78fsbj33f
Hark! I hear horses.	78fsbj33f
[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!	78fsbj33f
Then 'tis he: the rest	78fsbj33f
That are within the note of expectation	78fsbj33f
Already are i' the court.	78fsbj33f
His horses go about.	78fsbj33f
Almost a mile: but he does usually,	78fsbj33f
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate	78fsbj33f
Make it their walk.	78fsbj33f
A light, a light!	78fsbj33f
'Tis he.	78fsbj33f
Stand to't.	78fsbj33f
It will be rain to-night.	78fsbj33f
Let it come down.	78fsbj33f
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!	78fsbj33f
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!	78fsbj33f
Who did strike out the light?	78fsbj33f
Wast not the way?	78fsbj33f
There's but one down; the son is fled.	78fsbj33f
We have lost	78fsbj33f
Best half of our affair.	78fsbj33f
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.	78fsbj33f
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first	78fsbj33f
And last the hearty welcome.	78fsbj33f
Thanks to your majesty.	78fsbj33f
Ourself will mingle with society,	78fsbj33f
And play the humble host.	78fsbj33f
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time	78fsbj33f
We will require her welcome.	78fsbj33f
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;	78fsbj33f
For my heart speaks they are welcome.	78fsbj33f
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.	78fsbj33f
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:	78fsbj33f
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure	78fsbj33f
The table round.	78fsbj33f
There's blood on thy face.	78fsbj33f
'Tis Banquo's then.	78fsbj33f
'Tis better thee without than he within.	78fsbj33f
Is he dispatch'd?	78fsbj33f
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.	78fsbj33f
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good	78fsbj33f
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,	78fsbj33f
Thou art the nonpareil.	78fsbj33f
Most royal sir,	78fsbj33f
Fleance is 'scaped.	78fsbj33f
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,	78fsbj33f
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,	78fsbj33f
As broad and general as the casing air:	78fsbj33f
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in	78fsbj33f
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?	78fsbj33f
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,	78fsbj33f
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;	78fsbj33f
The least a death to nature.	78fsbj33f
Thanks for that:	78fsbj33f
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled	78fsbj33f
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,	78fsbj33f
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow	78fsbj33f
We'll hear, ourselves, again.	78fsbj33f
My royal lord,	78fsbj33f
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold	78fsbj33f
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,	78fsbj33f
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;	78fsbj33f
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;	78fsbj33f
Meeting were bare without it.	78fsbj33f
Sweet remembrancer!	78fsbj33f
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,	78fsbj33f
And health on both!	78fsbj33f
May't please your highness sit.	78fsbj33f
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,	78fsbj33f
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;	78fsbj33f
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness	78fsbj33f
Than pity for mischance!	78fsbj33f
His absence, sir,	78fsbj33f
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness	78fsbj33f
To grace us with your royal company.	78fsbj33f
The table's full.	78fsbj33f
Here is a place reserved, sir.	78fsbj33f
Where?	78fsbj33f
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?	78fsbj33f
Which of you have done this?	78fsbj33f
What, my good lord?	78fsbj33f
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake	78fsbj33f
Thy gory locks at me.	78fsbj33f
Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.	78fsbj33f
Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,	78fsbj33f
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;	78fsbj33f
The fit is momentary; upon a thought	78fsbj33f
He will again be well: if much you note him,	78fsbj33f
You shall offend him and extend his passion:	78fsbj33f
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?	78fsbj33f
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that	78fsbj33f
Which might appal the devil.	78fsbj33f
O proper stuff!	78fsbj33f
This is the very painting of your fear:	78fsbj33f
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,	78fsbj33f
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,	78fsbj33f
Impostors to true fear, would well become	78fsbj33f
A woman's story at a winter's fire,	78fsbj33f
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!	78fsbj33f
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,	78fsbj33f
You look but on a stool.	78fsbj33f
Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!	78fsbj33f
how say you?	78fsbj33f
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.	78fsbj33f
If charnel-houses and our graves must send	78fsbj33f
Those that we bury back, our monuments	78fsbj33f
Shall be the maws of kites.	78fsbj33f
What, quite unmann'd in folly?	78fsbj33f
If I stand here, I saw him.	78fsbj33f
Fie, for shame!	78fsbj33f
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,	78fsbj33f
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;	78fsbj33f
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd	78fsbj33f
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,	78fsbj33f
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,	78fsbj33f
And there an end; but now they rise again,	78fsbj33f
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,	78fsbj33f
And push us from our stools: this is more strange	78fsbj33f
Than such a murder is.	78fsbj33f
My worthy lord,	78fsbj33f
Your noble friends do lack you.	78fsbj33f
I do forget.	78fsbj33f
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,	78fsbj33f
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing	78fsbj33f
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;	78fsbj33f
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.	78fsbj33f
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,	78fsbj33f
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;	78fsbj33f
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,	78fsbj33f
And all to all.	78fsbj33f
Our duties, and the pledge.	78fsbj33f
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!	78fsbj33f
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;	78fsbj33f
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes	78fsbj33f
Which thou dost glare with!	78fsbj33f
Think of this, good peers,	78fsbj33f
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;	78fsbj33f
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.	78fsbj33f
What man dare, I dare:	78fsbj33f
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,	78fsbj33f
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;	78fsbj33f
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves	78fsbj33f
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,	78fsbj33f
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;	78fsbj33f
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me	78fsbj33f
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!	78fsbj33f
Unreal mockery, hence!	78fsbj33f
Why, so: being gone,	78fsbj33f
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.	78fsbj33f
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,	78fsbj33f
With most admired disorder.	78fsbj33f
Can such things be,	78fsbj33f
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,	78fsbj33f
Without our special wonder? You make me strange	78fsbj33f
Even to the disposition that I owe,	78fsbj33f
When now I think you can behold such sights,	78fsbj33f
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,	78fsbj33f
When mine is blanched with fear.	78fsbj33f
What sights, my lord?	78fsbj33f
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;	78fsbj33f
Question enrages him. At once, good night:	78fsbj33f
Stand not upon the order of your going,	78fsbj33f
But go at once.	78fsbj33f
Good night; and better health	78fsbj33f
Attend his majesty!	78fsbj33f
A kind good night to all!	78fsbj33f
It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:	78fsbj33f
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;	78fsbj33f
Augurs and understood relations have	78fsbj33f
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth	78fsbj33f
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?	78fsbj33f
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.	78fsbj33f
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person	78fsbj33f
At our great bidding?	78fsbj33f
Did you send to him, sir?	78fsbj33f
I hear it by the way; but I will send:	78fsbj33f
There's not a one of them but in his house	78fsbj33f
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,	78fsbj33f
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:	78fsbj33f
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,	78fsbj33f
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,	78fsbj33f
All causes shall give way: I am in blood	78fsbj33f
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,	78fsbj33f
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:	78fsbj33f
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;	78fsbj33f
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.	78fsbj33f
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.	78fsbj33f
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse	78fsbj33f
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:	78fsbj33f
We are yet but young in deed.	78fsbj33f
Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.	78fsbj33f
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,	78fsbj33f
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare	78fsbj33f
To trade and traffic with Macbeth	78fsbj33f
In riddles and affairs of death;	78fsbj33f
And I, the mistress of your charms,	78fsbj33f
The close contriver of all harms,	78fsbj33f
Was never call'd to bear my part,	78fsbj33f
Or show the glory of our art?	78fsbj33f
And, which is worse, all you have done	78fsbj33f
Hath been but for a wayward son,	78fsbj33f
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,	78fsbj33f
Loves for his own ends, not for you.	78fsbj33f
But make amends now: get you gone,	78fsbj33f
And at the pit of Acheron	78fsbj33f
Meet me i' the morning: thither he	78fsbj33f
Will come to know his destiny:	78fsbj33f
Your vessels and your spells provide,	78fsbj33f
Your charms and every thing beside.	78fsbj33f
I am for the air; this night I'll spend	78fsbj33f
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:	78fsbj33f
Great business must be wrought ere noon:	78fsbj33f
Upon the corner of the moon	78fsbj33f
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;	78fsbj33f
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:	78fsbj33f
And that distill'd by magic sleights	78fsbj33f
Shall raise such artificial sprites	78fsbj33f
As by the strength of their illusion	78fsbj33f
Shall draw him on to his confusion:	78fsbj33f
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear	78fsbj33f
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:	78fsbj33f
And you all know, security	78fsbj33f
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.	78fsbj33f
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,	78fsbj33f
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.	78fsbj33f
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.	78fsbj33f
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,	78fsbj33f
Which can interpret further: only, I say,	78fsbj33f
Things have been strangely borne. The	78fsbj33f
gracious Duncan	78fsbj33f
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:	78fsbj33f
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;	78fsbj33f
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,	78fsbj33f
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.	78fsbj33f
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous	78fsbj33f
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain	78fsbj33f
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!	78fsbj33f
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight	78fsbj33f
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,	78fsbj33f
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?	78fsbj33f
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;	78fsbj33f
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive	78fsbj33f
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	78fsbj33f
He has borne all things well: and I do think	78fsbj33f
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--	78fsbj33f
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they	78fsbj33f
should find	78fsbj33f
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.	78fsbj33f
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd	78fsbj33f
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear	78fsbj33f
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell	78fsbj33f
Where he bestows himself?	78fsbj33f
The son of Duncan,	78fsbj33f
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth	78fsbj33f
Lives in the English court, and is received	78fsbj33f
Of the most pious Edward with such grace	78fsbj33f
That the malevolence of fortune nothing	78fsbj33f
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff	78fsbj33f
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid	78fsbj33f
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:	78fsbj33f
That, by the help of these--with Him above	78fsbj33f
To ratify the work--we may again	78fsbj33f
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,	78fsbj33f
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,	78fsbj33f
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:	78fsbj33f
All which we pine for now: and this report	78fsbj33f
Hath so exasperate the king that he	78fsbj33f
Prepares for some attempt of war.	78fsbj33f
Sent he to Macduff?	78fsbj33f
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'	78fsbj33f
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,	78fsbj33f
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time	78fsbj33f
That clogs me with this answer.'	78fsbj33f
And that well might	78fsbj33f
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance	78fsbj33f
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel	78fsbj33f
Fly to the court of England and unfold	78fsbj33f
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing	78fsbj33f
May soon return to this our suffering country	78fsbj33f
Under a hand accursed!	78fsbj33f
I'll send my prayers with him.	78fsbj33f
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.	78fsbj33f
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.	78fsbj33f
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.	78fsbj33f
Round about the cauldron go;	78fsbj33f
In the poison'd entrails throw.	78fsbj33f
Toad, that under cold stone	78fsbj33f
Days and nights has thirty-one	78fsbj33f
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,	78fsbj33f
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.	78fsbj33f
Double, double toil and trouble;	78fsbj33f
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.	78fsbj33f
Fillet of a fenny snake,	78fsbj33f
In the cauldron boil and bake;	78fsbj33f
Eye of newt and toe of frog,	78fsbj33f
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,	78fsbj33f
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,	78fsbj33f
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,	78fsbj33f
For a charm of powerful trouble,	78fsbj33f
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.	78fsbj33f
Double, double toil and trouble;	78fsbj33f
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	78fsbj33f
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,	78fsbj33f
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf	78fsbj33f
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,	78fsbj33f
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,	78fsbj33f
Liver of blaspheming Jew,	78fsbj33f
Gall of goat, and slips of yew	78fsbj33f
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,	78fsbj33f
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,	78fsbj33f
Finger of birth-strangled babe	78fsbj33f
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,	78fsbj33f
Make the gruel thick and slab:	78fsbj33f
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,	78fsbj33f
For the ingredients of our cauldron.	78fsbj33f
Double, double toil and trouble;	78fsbj33f
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	78fsbj33f
Cool it with a baboon's blood,	78fsbj33f
Then the charm is firm and good.	78fsbj33f
O well done! I commend your pains;	78fsbj33f
And every one shall share i' the gains;	78fsbj33f
And now about the cauldron sing,	78fsbj33f
Live elves and fairies in a ring,	78fsbj33f
Enchanting all that you put in.	78fsbj33f
By the pricking of my thumbs,	78fsbj33f
Something wicked this way comes.	78fsbj33f
Open, locks,	78fsbj33f
Whoever knocks!	78fsbj33f
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!	78fsbj33f
What is't you do?	78fsbj33f
A deed without a name.	78fsbj33f
I conjure you, by that which you profess,	78fsbj33f
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:	78fsbj33f
Though you untie the winds and let them fight	78fsbj33f
Against the churches; though the yesty waves	78fsbj33f
Confound and swallow navigation up;	78fsbj33f
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;	78fsbj33f
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;	78fsbj33f
Though palaces and pyramids do slope	78fsbj33f
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure	78fsbj33f
Of nature's germens tumble all together,	78fsbj33f
Even till destruction sicken; answer me	78fsbj33f
To what I ask you.	78fsbj33f
Speak.	78fsbj33f
Demand.	78fsbj33f
We'll answer.	78fsbj33f
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,	78fsbj33f
Or from our masters?	78fsbj33f
Call 'em; let me see 'em.	78fsbj33f
Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten	78fsbj33f
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten	78fsbj33f
From the murderer's gibbet throw	78fsbj33f
Into the flame.	78fsbj33f
Come, high or low;	78fsbj33f
Thyself and office deftly show!	78fsbj33f
Tell me, thou unknown power,--	78fsbj33f
He knows thy thought:	78fsbj33f
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.	78fsbj33f
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;	78fsbj33f
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.	78fsbj33f
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;	78fsbj33f
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one	78fsbj33f
word more,--	78fsbj33f
He will not be commanded: here's another,	78fsbj33f
More potent than the first.	78fsbj33f
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!	78fsbj33f
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.	78fsbj33f
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn	78fsbj33f
The power of man, for none of woman born	78fsbj33f
Shall harm Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?	78fsbj33f
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,	78fsbj33f
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;	78fsbj33f
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,	78fsbj33f
And sleep in spite of thunder.	78fsbj33f
What is this	78fsbj33f
That rises like the issue of a king,	78fsbj33f
And wears upon his baby-brow the round	78fsbj33f
And top of sovereignty?	78fsbj33f
Listen, but speak not to't.	78fsbj33f
Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care	78fsbj33f
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:	78fsbj33f
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until	78fsbj33f
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill	78fsbj33f
Shall come against him.	78fsbj33f
That will never be	78fsbj33f
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree	78fsbj33f
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!	78fsbj33f
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood	78fsbj33f
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth	78fsbj33f
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath	78fsbj33f
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart	78fsbj33f
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art	78fsbj33f
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever	78fsbj33f
Reign in this kingdom?	78fsbj33f
Seek to know no more.	78fsbj33f
I will be satisfied: deny me this,	78fsbj33f
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.	78fsbj33f
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?	78fsbj33f
Show!	78fsbj33f
Show!	78fsbj33f
Show!	78fsbj33f
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;	78fsbj33f
Come like shadows, so depart!	78fsbj33f
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!	78fsbj33f
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,	78fsbj33f
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.	78fsbj33f
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!	78fsbj33f
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!	78fsbj33f
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?	78fsbj33f
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:	78fsbj33f
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass	78fsbj33f
Which shows me many more; and some I see	78fsbj33f
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:	78fsbj33f
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;	78fsbj33f
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,	78fsbj33f
And points at them for his.	78fsbj33f
What, is this so?	78fsbj33f
Ay, sir, all this is so: but why	78fsbj33f
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?	78fsbj33f
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,	78fsbj33f
And show the best of our delights:	78fsbj33f
I'll charm the air to give a sound,	78fsbj33f
While you perform your antic round:	78fsbj33f
That this great king may kindly say,	78fsbj33f
Our duties did his welcome pay.	78fsbj33f
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour	78fsbj33f
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!	78fsbj33f
Come in, without there!	78fsbj33f
What's your grace's will?	78fsbj33f
Saw you the weird sisters?	78fsbj33f
No, my lord.	78fsbj33f
Came they not by you?	78fsbj33f
No, indeed, my lord.	78fsbj33f
Infected be the air whereon they ride;	78fsbj33f
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear	78fsbj33f
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?	78fsbj33f
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word	78fsbj33f
Macduff is fled to England.	78fsbj33f
Fled to England!	78fsbj33f
Ay, my good lord.	78fsbj33f
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:	78fsbj33f
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook	78fsbj33f
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment	78fsbj33f
The very firstlings of my heart shall be	78fsbj33f
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,	78fsbj33f
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:	78fsbj33f
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;	78fsbj33f
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword	78fsbj33f
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls	78fsbj33f
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;	78fsbj33f
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.	78fsbj33f
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?	78fsbj33f
Come, bring me where they are.	78fsbj33f
What had he done, to make him fly the land?	78fsbj33f
You must have patience, madam.	78fsbj33f
He had none:	78fsbj33f
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,	78fsbj33f
Our fears do make us traitors.	78fsbj33f
You know not	78fsbj33f
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.	78fsbj33f
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,	78fsbj33f
His mansion and his titles in a place	78fsbj33f
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;	78fsbj33f
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,	78fsbj33f
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,	78fsbj33f
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.	78fsbj33f
All is the fear and nothing is the love;	78fsbj33f
As little is the wisdom, where the flight	78fsbj33f
So runs against all reason.	78fsbj33f
My dearest coz,	78fsbj33f
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,	78fsbj33f
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows	78fsbj33f
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak	78fsbj33f
much further;	78fsbj33f
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors	78fsbj33f
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour	78fsbj33f
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,	78fsbj33f
But float upon a wild and violent sea	78fsbj33f
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:	78fsbj33f
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:	78fsbj33f
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward	78fsbj33f
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,	78fsbj33f
Blessing upon you!	78fsbj33f
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.	78fsbj33f
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,	78fsbj33f
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:	78fsbj33f
I take my leave at once.	78fsbj33f
Sirrah, your father's dead;	78fsbj33f
And what will you do now? How will you live?	78fsbj33f
As birds do, mother.	78fsbj33f
What, with worms and flies?	78fsbj33f
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.	78fsbj33f
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,	78fsbj33f
The pitfall nor the gin.	78fsbj33f
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.	78fsbj33f
My father is not dead, for all your saying.	78fsbj33f
Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?	78fsbj33f
Nay, how will you do for a husband?	78fsbj33f
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.	78fsbj33f
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.	78fsbj33f
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,	78fsbj33f
With wit enough for thee.	78fsbj33f
Was my father a traitor, mother?	78fsbj33f
Ay, that he was.	78fsbj33f
What is a traitor?	78fsbj33f
Why, one that swears and lies.	78fsbj33f
And be all traitors that do so?	78fsbj33f
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.	78fsbj33f
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?	78fsbj33f
Every one.	78fsbj33f
Who must hang them?	78fsbj33f
Why,  the honest men.	78fsbj33f
Then the liars and swearers are fools,	78fsbj33f
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat	78fsbj33f
the honest men and hang up them.	78fsbj33f
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!	78fsbj33f
But how wilt thou do for a father?	78fsbj33f
If he were dead, you'ld weep for	78fsbj33f
him: if you would not, it were a good sign	78fsbj33f
that I should quickly have a new father.	78fsbj33f
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!	78fsbj33f
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,	78fsbj33f
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.	78fsbj33f
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:	78fsbj33f
If you will take a homely man's advice,	78fsbj33f
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.	78fsbj33f
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;	78fsbj33f
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,	78fsbj33f
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!	78fsbj33f
I dare abide no longer.	78fsbj33f
Whither should I fly?	78fsbj33f
I have done no harm. But I remember now	78fsbj33f
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm	78fsbj33f
Is often laudable, to do good sometime	78fsbj33f
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,	78fsbj33f
Do I put up that womanly defence,	78fsbj33f
To say I have done no harm?	78fsbj33f
What are these faces?	78fsbj33f
Where is your husband?	78fsbj33f
I hope, in no place so unsanctified	78fsbj33f
Where such as thou mayst find him.	78fsbj33f
He's a traitor.	78fsbj33f
Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!	78fsbj33f
What, you egg!	78fsbj33f
Young fry of treachery!	78fsbj33f
He has kill'd me, mother:	78fsbj33f
Run away, I pray you!	78fsbj33f
Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there	78fsbj33f
Weep our sad bosoms empty.	78fsbj33f
Let us rather	78fsbj33f
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men	78fsbj33f
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn	78fsbj33f
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows	78fsbj33f
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds	78fsbj33f
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out	78fsbj33f
Like syllable of dolour.	78fsbj33f
What I believe I'll wail,	78fsbj33f
What know believe, and what I can redress,	78fsbj33f
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.	78fsbj33f
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.	78fsbj33f
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,	78fsbj33f
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.	78fsbj33f
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;	78fsbj33f
but something	78fsbj33f
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom	78fsbj33f
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb	78fsbj33f
To appease an angry god.	78fsbj33f
I am not treacherous.	78fsbj33f
But Macbeth is.	78fsbj33f
A good and virtuous nature may recoil	78fsbj33f
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave	78fsbj33f
your pardon;	78fsbj33f
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:	78fsbj33f
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;	78fsbj33f
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,	78fsbj33f
Yet grace must still look so.	78fsbj33f
I have lost my hopes.	78fsbj33f
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.	78fsbj33f
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,	78fsbj33f
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,	78fsbj33f
Without leave-taking? I pray you,	78fsbj33f
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,	78fsbj33f
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,	78fsbj33f
Whatever I shall think.	78fsbj33f
Bleed, bleed, poor country!	78fsbj33f
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,	78fsbj33f
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou	78fsbj33f
thy wrongs;	78fsbj33f
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:	78fsbj33f
I would not be the villain that thou think'st	78fsbj33f
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,	78fsbj33f
And the rich East to boot.	78fsbj33f
Be not offended:	78fsbj33f
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	78fsbj33f
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;	78fsbj33f
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash	78fsbj33f
Is added to her wounds: I think withal	78fsbj33f
There would be hands uplifted in my right;	78fsbj33f
And here from gracious England have I offer	78fsbj33f
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,	78fsbj33f
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,	78fsbj33f
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country	78fsbj33f
Shall have more vices than it had before,	78fsbj33f
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,	78fsbj33f
By him that shall succeed.	78fsbj33f
What should he be?	78fsbj33f
It is myself I mean: in whom I know	78fsbj33f
All the particulars of vice so grafted	78fsbj33f
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth	78fsbj33f
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state	78fsbj33f
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared	78fsbj33f
With my confineless harms.	78fsbj33f
Not in the legions	78fsbj33f
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd	78fsbj33f
In evils to top Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
I grant him bloody,	78fsbj33f
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,	78fsbj33f
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin	78fsbj33f
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,	78fsbj33f
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,	78fsbj33f
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up	78fsbj33f
The cistern of my lust, and my desire	78fsbj33f
All continent impediments would o'erbear	78fsbj33f
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth	78fsbj33f
Than such an one to reign.	78fsbj33f
Boundless intemperance	78fsbj33f
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been	78fsbj33f
The untimely emptying of the happy throne	78fsbj33f
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet	78fsbj33f
To take upon you what is yours: you may	78fsbj33f
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,	78fsbj33f
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.	78fsbj33f
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be	78fsbj33f
That vulture in you, to devour so many	78fsbj33f
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,	78fsbj33f
Finding it so inclined.	78fsbj33f
With this there grows	78fsbj33f
In my most ill-composed affection such	78fsbj33f
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,	78fsbj33f
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,	78fsbj33f
Desire his jewels and this other's house:	78fsbj33f
And my more-having would be as a sauce	78fsbj33f
To make me hunger more; that I should forge	78fsbj33f
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,	78fsbj33f
Destroying them for wealth.	78fsbj33f
This avarice	78fsbj33f
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root	78fsbj33f
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been	78fsbj33f
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;	78fsbj33f
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.	78fsbj33f
Of your mere own: all these are portable,	78fsbj33f
With other graces weigh'd.	78fsbj33f
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,	78fsbj33f
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,	78fsbj33f
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,	78fsbj33f
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,	78fsbj33f
I have no relish of them, but abound	78fsbj33f
In the division of each several crime,	78fsbj33f
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should	78fsbj33f
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,	78fsbj33f
Uproar the universal peace, confound	78fsbj33f
All unity on earth.	78fsbj33f
O Scotland, Scotland!	78fsbj33f
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:	78fsbj33f
I am as I have spoken.	78fsbj33f
Fit to govern!	78fsbj33f
No, not to live. O nation miserable,	78fsbj33f
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,	78fsbj33f
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,	78fsbj33f
Since that the truest issue of thy throne	78fsbj33f
By his own interdiction stands accursed,	78fsbj33f
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father	78fsbj33f
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,	78fsbj33f
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,	78fsbj33f
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!	78fsbj33f
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself	78fsbj33f
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,	78fsbj33f
Thy hope ends here!	78fsbj33f
Macduff, this noble passion,	78fsbj33f
Child of integrity, hath from my soul	78fsbj33f
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts	78fsbj33f
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth	78fsbj33f
By many of these trains hath sought to win me	78fsbj33f
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me	78fsbj33f
From over-credulous haste: but God above	78fsbj33f
Deal between thee and me! for even now	78fsbj33f
I put myself to thy direction, and	78fsbj33f
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure	78fsbj33f
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,	78fsbj33f
For strangers to my nature. I am yet	78fsbj33f
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,	78fsbj33f
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,	78fsbj33f
At no time broke my faith, would not betray	78fsbj33f
The devil to his fellow and delight	78fsbj33f
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking	78fsbj33f
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,	78fsbj33f
Is thine and my poor country's to command:	78fsbj33f
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,	78fsbj33f
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,	78fsbj33f
Already at a point, was setting forth.	78fsbj33f
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness	78fsbj33f
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?	78fsbj33f
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once	78fsbj33f
'Tis hard to reconcile.	78fsbj33f
Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?	78fsbj33f
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls	78fsbj33f
That stay his cure: their malady convinces	78fsbj33f
The great assay of art; but at his touch--	78fsbj33f
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--	78fsbj33f
They presently amend.	78fsbj33f
I thank you, doctor.	78fsbj33f
What's the disease he means?	78fsbj33f
'Tis call'd the evil:	78fsbj33f
A most miraculous work in this good king;	78fsbj33f
Which often, since my here-remain in England,	78fsbj33f
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,	78fsbj33f
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,	78fsbj33f
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,	78fsbj33f
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,	78fsbj33f
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,	78fsbj33f
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,	78fsbj33f
To the succeeding royalty he leaves	78fsbj33f
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,	78fsbj33f
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,	78fsbj33f
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,	78fsbj33f
That speak him full of grace.	78fsbj33f
See, who comes here?	78fsbj33f
My countryman; but yet I know him not.	78fsbj33f
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.	78fsbj33f
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove	78fsbj33f
The means that makes us strangers!	78fsbj33f
Sir, amen.	78fsbj33f
Stands Scotland where it did?	78fsbj33f
Alas, poor country!	78fsbj33f
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot	78fsbj33f
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,	78fsbj33f
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;	78fsbj33f
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air	78fsbj33f
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems	78fsbj33f
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell	78fsbj33f
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives	78fsbj33f
Expire before the flowers in their caps,	78fsbj33f
Dying or ere they sicken.	78fsbj33f
O, relation	78fsbj33f
Too nice, and yet too true!	78fsbj33f
What's the newest grief?	78fsbj33f
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:	78fsbj33f
Each minute teems a new one.	78fsbj33f
How does my wife?	78fsbj33f
Why, well.	78fsbj33f
And all my children?	78fsbj33f
Well too.	78fsbj33f
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?	78fsbj33f
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.	78fsbj33f
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?	78fsbj33f
When I came hither to transport the tidings,	78fsbj33f
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour	78fsbj33f
Of many worthy fellows that were out;	78fsbj33f
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,	78fsbj33f
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:	78fsbj33f
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland	78fsbj33f
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,	78fsbj33f
To doff their dire distresses.	78fsbj33f
Be't their comfort	78fsbj33f
We are coming thither: gracious England hath	78fsbj33f
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;	78fsbj33f
An older and a better soldier none	78fsbj33f
That Christendom gives out.	78fsbj33f
Would I could answer	78fsbj33f
This comfort with the like! But I have words	78fsbj33f
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,	78fsbj33f
Where hearing should not latch them.	78fsbj33f
What concern they?	78fsbj33f
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief	78fsbj33f
Due to some single breast?	78fsbj33f
No mind that's honest	78fsbj33f
But in it shares some woe; though the main part	78fsbj33f
Pertains to you alone.	78fsbj33f
If it be mine,	78fsbj33f
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.	78fsbj33f
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,	78fsbj33f
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound	78fsbj33f
That ever yet they heard.	78fsbj33f
Hum! I guess at it.	78fsbj33f
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes	78fsbj33f
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,	78fsbj33f
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,	78fsbj33f
To add the death of you.	78fsbj33f
Merciful heaven!	78fsbj33f
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;	78fsbj33f
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak	78fsbj33f
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.	78fsbj33f
My children too?	78fsbj33f
Wife, children, servants, all	78fsbj33f
That could be found.	78fsbj33f
And I must be from thence!	78fsbj33f
My wife kill'd too?	78fsbj33f
I have said.	78fsbj33f
Be comforted:	78fsbj33f
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,	78fsbj33f
To cure this deadly grief.	78fsbj33f
He has no children. All my pretty ones?	78fsbj33f
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?	78fsbj33f
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam	78fsbj33f
At one fell swoop?	78fsbj33f
Dispute it like a man.	78fsbj33f
I shall do so;	78fsbj33f
But I must also feel it as a man:	78fsbj33f
I cannot but remember such things were,	78fsbj33f
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,	78fsbj33f
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,	78fsbj33f
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,	78fsbj33f
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,	78fsbj33f
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!	78fsbj33f
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief	78fsbj33f
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.	78fsbj33f
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes	78fsbj33f
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,	78fsbj33f
Cut short all intermission; front to front	78fsbj33f
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;	78fsbj33f
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,	78fsbj33f
Heaven forgive him too!	78fsbj33f
This tune goes manly.	78fsbj33f
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;	78fsbj33f
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth	78fsbj33f
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above	78fsbj33f
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:	78fsbj33f
The night is long that never finds the day.	78fsbj33f
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive	78fsbj33f
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?	78fsbj33f
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen	78fsbj33f
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon	78fsbj33f
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,	78fsbj33f
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again	78fsbj33f
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	78fsbj33f
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once	78fsbj33f
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of	78fsbj33f
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her	78fsbj33f
walking and other actual performances, what, at any	78fsbj33f
time, have you heard her say?	78fsbj33f
That, sir, which I will not report after her.	78fsbj33f
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.	78fsbj33f
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to	78fsbj33f
confirm my speech.	78fsbj33f
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;	78fsbj33f
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.	78fsbj33f
How came she by that light?	78fsbj33f
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her	78fsbj33f
continually; 'tis her command.	78fsbj33f
You see, her eyes are open.	78fsbj33f
Ay, but their sense is shut.	78fsbj33f
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.	78fsbj33f
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus	78fsbj33f
washing her hands: I have known her continue in	78fsbj33f
this a quarter of an hour.	78fsbj33f
Yet here's a spot.	78fsbj33f
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from	78fsbj33f
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.	78fsbj33f
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,	78fsbj33f
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my	78fsbj33f
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we	78fsbj33f
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to	78fsbj33f
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man	78fsbj33f
to have had so much blood in him.	78fsbj33f
Do you mark that?	78fsbj33f
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--	78fsbj33f
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'	78fsbj33f
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with	78fsbj33f
this starting.	78fsbj33f
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.	78fsbj33f
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of	78fsbj33f
that: heaven knows what she has known.	78fsbj33f
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the	78fsbj33f
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little	78fsbj33f
hand. Oh, oh, oh!	78fsbj33f
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.	78fsbj33f
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the	78fsbj33f
dignity of the whole body.	78fsbj33f
Well, well, well,--	78fsbj33f
Pray God it be, sir.	78fsbj33f
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known	78fsbj33f
those which have walked in their sleep who have died	78fsbj33f
holily in their beds.	78fsbj33f
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so	78fsbj33f
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he	78fsbj33f
cannot come out on's grave.	78fsbj33f
Even so?	78fsbj33f
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:	78fsbj33f
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's	78fsbj33f
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!	78fsbj33f
Will she go now to bed?	78fsbj33f
Directly.	78fsbj33f
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds	78fsbj33f
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds	78fsbj33f
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:	78fsbj33f
More needs she the divine than the physician.	78fsbj33f
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;	78fsbj33f
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,	78fsbj33f
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:	78fsbj33f
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.	78fsbj33f
I think, but dare not speak.	78fsbj33f
Good night, good doctor.	78fsbj33f
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,	78fsbj33f
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:	78fsbj33f
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes	78fsbj33f
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm	78fsbj33f
Excite the mortified man.	78fsbj33f
Near Birnam wood	78fsbj33f
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.	78fsbj33f
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?	78fsbj33f
For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file	78fsbj33f
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,	78fsbj33f
And many unrough youths that even now	78fsbj33f
Protest their first of manhood.	78fsbj33f
What does the tyrant?	78fsbj33f
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:	78fsbj33f
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him	78fsbj33f
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,	78fsbj33f
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause	78fsbj33f
Within the belt of rule.	78fsbj33f
Now does he feel	78fsbj33f
His secret murders sticking on his hands;	78fsbj33f
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;	78fsbj33f
Those he commands move only in command,	78fsbj33f
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title	78fsbj33f
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe	78fsbj33f
Upon a dwarfish thief.	78fsbj33f
Who then shall blame	78fsbj33f
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,	78fsbj33f
When all that is within him does condemn	78fsbj33f
Itself for being there?	78fsbj33f
Well, march we on,	78fsbj33f
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:	78fsbj33f
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,	78fsbj33f
And with him pour we in our country's purge	78fsbj33f
Each drop of us.	78fsbj33f
Or so much as it needs,	78fsbj33f
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.	78fsbj33f
Make we our march towards Birnam.	78fsbj33f
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:	78fsbj33f
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,	78fsbj33f
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?	78fsbj33f
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know	78fsbj33f
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:	78fsbj33f
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman	78fsbj33f
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,	78fsbj33f
false thanes,	78fsbj33f
And mingle with the English epicures:	78fsbj33f
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear	78fsbj33f
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.	78fsbj33f
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!	78fsbj33f
Where got'st thou that goose look?	78fsbj33f
There is ten thousand--	78fsbj33f
Geese, villain!	78fsbj33f
Soldiers, sir.	78fsbj33f
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,	78fsbj33f
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?	78fsbj33f
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine	78fsbj33f
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?	78fsbj33f
The English force, so please you.	78fsbj33f
Take thy face hence.	78fsbj33f
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,	78fsbj33f
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push	78fsbj33f
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.	78fsbj33f
I have lived long enough: my way of life	78fsbj33f
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;	78fsbj33f
And that which should accompany old age,	78fsbj33f
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,	78fsbj33f
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,	78fsbj33f
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,	78fsbj33f
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!	78fsbj33f
What is your gracious pleasure?	78fsbj33f
What news more?	78fsbj33f
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.	78fsbj33f
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.	78fsbj33f
Give me my armour.	78fsbj33f
'Tis not needed yet.	78fsbj33f
I'll put it on.	78fsbj33f
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;	78fsbj33f
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.	78fsbj33f
How does your patient, doctor?	78fsbj33f
Not so sick, my lord,	78fsbj33f
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,	78fsbj33f
That keep her from her rest.	78fsbj33f
Cure her of that.	78fsbj33f
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,	78fsbj33f
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,	78fsbj33f
Raze out the written troubles of the brain	78fsbj33f
And with some sweet oblivious antidote	78fsbj33f
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff	78fsbj33f
Which weighs upon the heart?	78fsbj33f
Therein the patient	78fsbj33f
Must minister to himself.	78fsbj33f
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.	78fsbj33f
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.	78fsbj33f
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.	78fsbj33f
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast	78fsbj33f
The water of my land, find her disease,	78fsbj33f
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,	78fsbj33f
I would applaud thee to the very echo,	78fsbj33f
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--	78fsbj33f
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,	78fsbj33f
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?	78fsbj33f
Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation	78fsbj33f
Makes us hear something.	78fsbj33f
Bring it after me.	78fsbj33f
I will not be afraid of death and bane,	78fsbj33f
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.	78fsbj33f
[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,	78fsbj33f
Profit again should hardly draw me here.	78fsbj33f
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand	78fsbj33f
That chambers will be safe.	78fsbj33f
We doubt it nothing.	78fsbj33f
What wood is this before us?	78fsbj33f
The wood of Birnam.	78fsbj33f
Let every soldier hew him down a bough	78fsbj33f
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow	78fsbj33f
The numbers of our host and make discovery	78fsbj33f
Err in report of us.	78fsbj33f
It shall be done.	78fsbj33f
We learn no other but the confident tyrant	78fsbj33f
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure	78fsbj33f
Our setting down before 't.	78fsbj33f
'Tis his main hope:	78fsbj33f
For where there is advantage to be given,	78fsbj33f
Both more and less have given him the revolt,	78fsbj33f
And none serve with him but constrained things	78fsbj33f
Whose hearts are absent too.	78fsbj33f
Let our just censures	78fsbj33f
Attend the true event, and put we on	78fsbj33f
Industrious soldiership.	78fsbj33f
The time approaches	78fsbj33f
That will with due decision make us know	78fsbj33f
What we shall say we have and what we owe.	78fsbj33f
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,	78fsbj33f
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:	78fsbj33f
Towards which advance the war.	78fsbj33f
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;	78fsbj33f
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength	78fsbj33f
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie	78fsbj33f
Till famine and the ague eat them up:	78fsbj33f
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,	78fsbj33f
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,	78fsbj33f
And beat them backward home.	78fsbj33f
What is that noise?	78fsbj33f
It is the cry of women, my good lord.	78fsbj33f
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;	78fsbj33f
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd	78fsbj33f
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair	78fsbj33f
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir	78fsbj33f
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;	78fsbj33f
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts	78fsbj33f
Cannot once start me.	78fsbj33f
Wherefore was that cry?	78fsbj33f
The queen, my lord, is dead.	78fsbj33f
She should have died hereafter;	78fsbj33f
There would have been a time for such a word.	78fsbj33f
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,	78fsbj33f
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day	78fsbj33f
To the last syllable of recorded time,	78fsbj33f
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools	78fsbj33f
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!	78fsbj33f
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player	78fsbj33f
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage	78fsbj33f
And then is heard no more: it is a tale	78fsbj33f
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,	78fsbj33f
Signifying nothing.	78fsbj33f
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.	78fsbj33f
Gracious my lord,	78fsbj33f
I should report that which I say I saw,	78fsbj33f
But know not how to do it.	78fsbj33f
Well, say, sir.	78fsbj33f
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,	78fsbj33f
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,	78fsbj33f
The wood began to move.	78fsbj33f
Liar and slave!	78fsbj33f
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:	78fsbj33f
Within this three mile may you see it coming;	78fsbj33f
I say, a moving grove.	78fsbj33f
If thou speak'st false,	78fsbj33f
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,	78fsbj33f
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,	78fsbj33f
I care not if thou dost for me as much.	78fsbj33f
I pull in resolution, and begin	78fsbj33f
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend	78fsbj33f
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood	78fsbj33f
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood	78fsbj33f
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!	78fsbj33f
If this which he avouches does appear,	78fsbj33f
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.	78fsbj33f
I gin to be aweary of the sun,	78fsbj33f
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.	78fsbj33f
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!	78fsbj33f
At least we'll die with harness on our back.	78fsbj33f
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.	78fsbj33f
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,	78fsbj33f
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,	78fsbj33f
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we	78fsbj33f
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,	78fsbj33f
According to our order.	78fsbj33f
Fare you well.	78fsbj33f
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,	78fsbj33f
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.	78fsbj33f
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,	78fsbj33f
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.	78fsbj33f
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,	78fsbj33f
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he	78fsbj33f
That was not born of woman? Such a one	78fsbj33f
Am I to fear, or none.	78fsbj33f
What is thy name?	78fsbj33f
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.	78fsbj33f
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name	78fsbj33f
Than any is in hell.	78fsbj33f
My name's Macbeth.	78fsbj33f
The devil himself could not pronounce a title	78fsbj33f
More hateful to mine ear.	78fsbj33f
No, nor more fearful.	78fsbj33f
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword	78fsbj33f
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	78fsbj33f
Thou wast born of woman	78fsbj33f
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,	78fsbj33f
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.	78fsbj33f
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!	78fsbj33f
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,	78fsbj33f
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.	78fsbj33f
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms	78fsbj33f
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,	78fsbj33f
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge	78fsbj33f
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;	78fsbj33f
By this great clatter, one of greatest note	78fsbj33f
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!	78fsbj33f
And more I beg not.	78fsbj33f
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:	78fsbj33f
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;	78fsbj33f
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;	78fsbj33f
The day almost itself professes yours,	78fsbj33f
And little is to do.	78fsbj33f
We have met with foes	78fsbj33f
That strike beside us.	78fsbj33f
Enter, sir, the castle.	78fsbj33f
Why should I play the Roman fool, and die	78fsbj33f
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes	78fsbj33f
Do better upon them.	78fsbj33f
Turn, hell-hound, turn!	78fsbj33f
Of all men else I have avoided thee:	78fsbj33f
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged	78fsbj33f
With blood of thine already.	78fsbj33f
I have no words:	78fsbj33f
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain	78fsbj33f
Than terms can give thee out!	78fsbj33f
Thou losest labour:	78fsbj33f
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air	78fsbj33f
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:	78fsbj33f
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;	78fsbj33f
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,	78fsbj33f
To one of woman born.	78fsbj33f
Despair thy charm;	78fsbj33f
And let the angel whom thou still hast served	78fsbj33f
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb	78fsbj33f
Untimely ripp'd.	78fsbj33f
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,	78fsbj33f
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!	78fsbj33f
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,	78fsbj33f
That palter with us in a double sense;	78fsbj33f
That keep the word of promise to our ear,	78fsbj33f
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.	78fsbj33f
Then yield thee, coward,	78fsbj33f
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:	78fsbj33f
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,	78fsbj33f
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,	78fsbj33f
'Here may you see the tyrant.'	78fsbj33f
I will not yield,	78fsbj33f
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,	78fsbj33f
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.	78fsbj33f
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,	78fsbj33f
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,	78fsbj33f
Yet I will try the last. Before my body	78fsbj33f
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,	78fsbj33f
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'	78fsbj33f
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.	78fsbj33f
Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,	78fsbj33f
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.	78fsbj33f
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	78fsbj33f
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:	78fsbj33f
He only lived but till he was a man;	78fsbj33f
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd	78fsbj33f
In the unshrinking station where he fought,	78fsbj33f
But like a man he died.	78fsbj33f
Then he is dead?	78fsbj33f
Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow	78fsbj33f
Must not be measured by his worth, for then	78fsbj33f
It hath no end.	78fsbj33f
Had he his hurts before?	78fsbj33f
Ay, on the front.	78fsbj33f
Why then, God's soldier be he!	78fsbj33f
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,	78fsbj33f
I would not wish them to a fairer death:	78fsbj33f
And so, his knell is knoll'd.	78fsbj33f
He's worth more sorrow,	78fsbj33f
And that I'll spend for him.	78fsbj33f
He's worth no more	78fsbj33f
They say he parted well, and paid his score:	78fsbj33f
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.	78fsbj33f
Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands	78fsbj33f
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:	78fsbj33f
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,	78fsbj33f
That speak my salutation in their minds;	78fsbj33f
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:	78fsbj33f
Hail, King of Scotland!	78fsbj33f
Hail, King of Scotland!	78fsbj33f
We shall not spend a large expense of time	78fsbj33f
Before we reckon with your several loves,	78fsbj33f
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,	78fsbj33f
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland	78fsbj33f
In such an honour named. What's more to do,	78fsbj33f
Which would be planted newly with the time,	78fsbj33f
As calling home our exiled friends abroad	78fsbj33f
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;	78fsbj33f
Producing forth the cruel ministers	78fsbj33f
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,	78fsbj33f
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands	78fsbj33f
Took off her life; this, and what needful else	78fsbj33f
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,	78fsbj33f
We will perform in measure, time and place:	78fsbj33f
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,	78fsbj33f
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.	78fsbj33f
