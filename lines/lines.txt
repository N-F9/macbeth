When shall we three meet again	First Witch
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?	First Witch
When the hurlyburly's done,	Second Witch
When the battle's lost and won.	Second Witch
That will be ere the set of sun.	Third Witch
Where the place?	First Witch
Upon the heath.	Second Witch
There to meet with Macbeth.	Third Witch
I come, Graymalkin!	First Witch
Paddock calls.	Second Witch
Anon.	Third Witch
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:	ALL
Hover through the fog and filthy air.	ALL
What bloody man is that? He can report,	DUNCAN
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt	DUNCAN
The newest state.	DUNCAN
This is the sergeant	MALCOLM
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought	MALCOLM
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!	MALCOLM
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil	MALCOLM
As thou didst leave it.	MALCOLM
Doubtful it stood;	Sergeant
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together	Sergeant
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--	Sergeant
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that	Sergeant
The multiplying villanies of nature	Sergeant
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles	Sergeant
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;	Sergeant
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,	Sergeant
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:	Sergeant
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--	Sergeant
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,	Sergeant
Which smoked with bloody execution,	Sergeant
Like valour's minion carved out his passage	Sergeant
Till he faced the slave;	Sergeant
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,	Sergeant
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,	Sergeant
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.	Sergeant
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!	DUNCAN
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection	Sergeant
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,	Sergeant
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come	Sergeant
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:	Sergeant
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd	Sergeant
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,	Sergeant
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,	Sergeant
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men	Sergeant
Began a fresh assault.	Sergeant
Dismay'd not this	DUNCAN
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?	DUNCAN
Yes;	Sergeant
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.	Sergeant
If I say sooth, I must report they were	Sergeant
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they	Sergeant
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:	Sergeant
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,	Sergeant
Or memorise another Golgotha,	Sergeant
I cannot tell.	Sergeant
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.	Sergeant
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;	DUNCAN
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.	DUNCAN
Who comes here?	DUNCAN
The worthy thane of Ross.	MALCOLM
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look	LENNOX
That seems to speak things strange.	LENNOX
God save the king!	ROSS
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?	DUNCAN
From Fife, great king;	ROSS
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky	ROSS
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,	ROSS
With terrible numbers,	ROSS
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor	ROSS
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;	ROSS
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,	ROSS
Confronted him with self-comparisons,	ROSS
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.	ROSS
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,	ROSS
The victory fell on us.	ROSS
Great happiness!	DUNCAN
That now	ROSS
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:	ROSS
Nor would we deign him burial of his men	ROSS
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch	ROSS
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.	ROSS
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive	DUNCAN
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,	DUNCAN
And with his former title greet Macbeth.	DUNCAN
I'll see it done.	ROSS
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.	DUNCAN
Where hast thou been, sister?	First Witch
Killing swine.	Second Witch
Sister, where thou?	Third Witch
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,	First Witch
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--	First Witch
'Give me,' quoth I:	First Witch
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.	First Witch
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:	First Witch
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,	First Witch
And, like a rat without a tail,	First Witch
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.	First Witch
I'll give thee a wind.	Second Witch
Thou'rt kind.	First Witch
And I another.	Third Witch
I myself have all the other,	First Witch
And the very ports they blow,	First Witch
All the quarters that they know	First Witch
I' the shipman's card.	First Witch
I will drain him dry as hay:	First Witch
Sleep shall neither night nor day	First Witch
Hang upon his pent-house lid;	First Witch
He shall live a man forbid:	First Witch
Weary se'nnights nine times nine	First Witch
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:	First Witch
Though his bark cannot be lost,	First Witch
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.	First Witch
Look what I have.	First Witch
Show me, show me.	Second Witch
Here I have a pilot's thumb,	First Witch
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.	First Witch
A drum, a drum!	Third Witch
Macbeth doth come.	Third Witch
The weird sisters, hand in hand,	ALL
Posters of the sea and land,	ALL
Thus do go about, about:	ALL
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine	ALL
And thrice again, to make up nine.	ALL
Peace! the charm's wound up.	ALL
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.	MACBETH
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these	BANQUO
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,	BANQUO
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,	BANQUO
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught	BANQUO
That man may question? You seem to understand me,	BANQUO
By each at once her chappy finger laying	BANQUO
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,	BANQUO
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret	BANQUO
That you are so.	BANQUO
Speak, if you can: what are you?	MACBETH
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!	First Witch
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!	Second Witch
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!	Third Witch
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear	BANQUO
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,	BANQUO
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed	BANQUO
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner	BANQUO
You greet with present grace and great prediction	BANQUO
Of noble having and of royal hope,	BANQUO
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.	BANQUO
If you can look into the seeds of time,	BANQUO
And say which grain will grow and which will not,	BANQUO
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear	BANQUO
Your favours nor your hate.	BANQUO
Hail!	First Witch
Hail!	Second Witch
Hail!	Third Witch
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.	First Witch
Not so happy, yet much happier.	Second Witch
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:	Third Witch
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!	Third Witch
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!	First Witch
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:	MACBETH
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;	MACBETH
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,	MACBETH
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king	MACBETH
Stands not within the prospect of belief,	MACBETH
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence	MACBETH
You owe this strange intelligence? or why	MACBETH
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way	MACBETH
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.	MACBETH
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,	BANQUO
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?	BANQUO
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted	MACBETH
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!	MACBETH
Were such things here as we do speak about?	BANQUO
Or have we eaten on the insane root	BANQUO
That takes the reason prisoner?	BANQUO
Your children shall be kings.	MACBETH
You shall be king.	BANQUO
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?	MACBETH
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?	BANQUO
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,	ROSS
The news of thy success; and when he reads	ROSS
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,	ROSS
His wonders and his praises do contend	ROSS
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,	ROSS
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,	ROSS
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,	ROSS
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,	ROSS
Strange images of death. As thick as hail	ROSS
Came post with post; and every one did bear	ROSS
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,	ROSS
And pour'd them down before him.	ROSS
We are sent	ANGUS
To give thee from our royal master thanks;	ANGUS
Only to herald thee into his sight,	ANGUS
Not pay thee.	ANGUS
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,	ROSS
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:	ROSS
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!	ROSS
For it is thine.	ROSS
What, can the devil speak true?	BANQUO
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me	MACBETH
In borrow'd robes?	MACBETH
Who was the thane lives yet;	ANGUS
But under heavy judgment bears that life	ANGUS
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined	ANGUS
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel	ANGUS
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both	ANGUS
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;	ANGUS
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,	ANGUS
Have overthrown him.	ANGUS
[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!	MACBETH
The greatest is behind.	MACBETH
Thanks for your pains.	MACBETH
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,	MACBETH
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me	MACBETH
Promised no less to them?	MACBETH
That trusted home	BANQUO
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,	BANQUO
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:	BANQUO
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,	BANQUO
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,	BANQUO
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's	BANQUO
In deepest consequence.	BANQUO
Cousins, a word, I pray you.	BANQUO
[Aside]  Two truths are told,	MACBETH
As happy prologues to the swelling act	MACBETH
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.	MACBETH
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,	MACBETH
Why hath it given me earnest of success,	MACBETH
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:	MACBETH
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion	MACBETH
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair	MACBETH
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,	MACBETH
Against the use of nature? Present fears	MACBETH
Are less than horrible imaginings:	MACBETH
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,	MACBETH
Shakes so my single state of man that function	MACBETH
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is	MACBETH
But what is not.	MACBETH
Look, how our partner's rapt.	BANQUO
[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,	MACBETH
Without my stir.	MACBETH
New horrors come upon him,	BANQUO
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould	BANQUO
But with the aid of use.	BANQUO
[Aside]  Come what come may,	MACBETH
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.	MACBETH
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	BANQUO
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought	MACBETH
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains	MACBETH
Are register'd where every day I turn	MACBETH
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.	MACBETH
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,	MACBETH
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak	MACBETH
Our free hearts each to other.	MACBETH
Very gladly.	BANQUO
Till then, enough. Come, friends.	MACBETH
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not	DUNCAN
Those in commission yet return'd?	DUNCAN
My liege,	MALCOLM
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke	MALCOLM
With one that saw him die: who did report	MALCOLM
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,	MALCOLM
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth	MALCOLM
A deep repentance: nothing in his life	MALCOLM
Became him like the leaving it; he died	MALCOLM
As one that had been studied in his death	MALCOLM
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,	MALCOLM
As 'twere a careless trifle.	MALCOLM
There's no art	DUNCAN
To find the mind's construction in the face:	DUNCAN
He was a gentleman on whom I built	DUNCAN
An absolute trust.	DUNCAN
O worthiest cousin!	DUNCAN
The sin of my ingratitude even now	DUNCAN
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before	DUNCAN
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow	DUNCAN
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,	DUNCAN
That the proportion both of thanks and payment	DUNCAN
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,	DUNCAN
More is thy due than more than all can pay.	DUNCAN
The service and the loyalty I owe,	MACBETH
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part	MACBETH
Is to receive our duties; and our duties	MACBETH
Are to your throne and state children and servants,	MACBETH
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing	MACBETH
Safe toward your love and honour.	MACBETH
Welcome hither:	DUNCAN
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour	DUNCAN
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,	DUNCAN
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known	DUNCAN
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee	DUNCAN
And hold thee to my heart.	DUNCAN
There if I grow,	BANQUO
The harvest is your own.	BANQUO
My plenteous joys,	DUNCAN
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves	DUNCAN
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,	DUNCAN
And you whose places are the nearest, know	DUNCAN
We will establish our estate upon	DUNCAN
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter	DUNCAN
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must	DUNCAN
Not unaccompanied invest him only,	DUNCAN
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine	DUNCAN
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,	DUNCAN
And bind us further to you.	DUNCAN
The rest is labour, which is not used for you:	MACBETH
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful	MACBETH
The hearing of my wife with your approach;	MACBETH
So humbly take my leave.	MACBETH
My worthy Cawdor!	DUNCAN
[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step	MACBETH
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,	MACBETH
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;	MACBETH
Let not light see my black and deep desires:	MACBETH
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,	MACBETH
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.	MACBETH
True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,	DUNCAN
And in his commendations I am fed;	DUNCAN
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,	DUNCAN
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:	DUNCAN
It is a peerless kinsman.	DUNCAN
'They met me in the day of success: and I have	LADY MACBETH
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in	LADY MACBETH
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire	LADY MACBETH
to question them further, they made themselves air,	LADY MACBETH
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in	LADY MACBETH
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who	LADY MACBETH
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,	LADY MACBETH
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred	LADY MACBETH
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that	LADY MACBETH
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver	LADY MACBETH
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou	LADY MACBETH
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being	LADY MACBETH
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it	LADY MACBETH
to thy heart, and farewell.'	LADY MACBETH
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be	LADY MACBETH
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;	LADY MACBETH
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness	LADY MACBETH
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;	LADY MACBETH
Art not without ambition, but without	LADY MACBETH
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,	LADY MACBETH
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,	LADY MACBETH
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,	LADY MACBETH
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;	LADY MACBETH
And that which rather thou dost fear to do	LADY MACBETH
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,	LADY MACBETH
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;	LADY MACBETH
And chastise with the valour of my tongue	LADY MACBETH
All that impedes thee from the golden round,	LADY MACBETH
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem	LADY MACBETH
To have thee crown'd withal.	LADY MACBETH
What is your tidings?	LADY MACBETH
The king comes here to-night.	Messenger
Thou'rt mad to say it:	LADY MACBETH
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,	LADY MACBETH
Would have inform'd for preparation.	LADY MACBETH
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:	Messenger
One of my fellows had the speed of him,	Messenger
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more	Messenger
Than would make up his message.	Messenger
Give him tending;	LADY MACBETH
He brings great news.	LADY MACBETH
The raven himself is hoarse	LADY MACBETH
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan	LADY MACBETH
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits	LADY MACBETH
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,	LADY MACBETH
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full	LADY MACBETH
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;	LADY MACBETH
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,	LADY MACBETH
That no compunctious visitings of nature	LADY MACBETH
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between	LADY MACBETH
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,	LADY MACBETH
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,	LADY MACBETH
Wherever in your sightless substances	LADY MACBETH
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,	LADY MACBETH
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,	LADY MACBETH
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,	LADY MACBETH
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,	LADY MACBETH
To cry 'Hold, hold!'	LADY MACBETH
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!	LADY MACBETH
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!	LADY MACBETH
Thy letters have transported me beyond	LADY MACBETH
This ignorant present, and I feel now	LADY MACBETH
The future in the instant.	LADY MACBETH
My dearest love,	MACBETH
Duncan comes here to-night.	MACBETH
And when goes hence?	LADY MACBETH
To-morrow, as he purposes.	MACBETH
O, never	LADY MACBETH
Shall sun that morrow see!	LADY MACBETH
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men	LADY MACBETH
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,	LADY MACBETH
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,	LADY MACBETH
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,	LADY MACBETH
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming	LADY MACBETH
Must be provided for: and you shall put	LADY MACBETH
This night's great business into my dispatch;	LADY MACBETH
Which shall to all our nights and days to come	LADY MACBETH
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.	LADY MACBETH
We will speak further.	MACBETH
Only look up clear;	LADY MACBETH
To alter favour ever is to fear:	LADY MACBETH
Leave all the rest to me.	LADY MACBETH
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air	DUNCAN
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself	DUNCAN
Unto our gentle senses.	DUNCAN
This guest of summer,	BANQUO
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,	BANQUO
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath	BANQUO
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,	BANQUO
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird	BANQUO
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:	BANQUO
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,	BANQUO
The air is delicate.	BANQUO
See, see, our honour'd hostess!	DUNCAN
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,	DUNCAN
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you	DUNCAN
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,	DUNCAN
And thank us for your trouble.	DUNCAN
All our service	LADY MACBETH
In every point twice done and then done double	LADY MACBETH
Were poor and single business to contend	LADY MACBETH
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith	LADY MACBETH
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,	LADY MACBETH
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,	LADY MACBETH
We rest your hermits.	LADY MACBETH
Where's the thane of Cawdor?	DUNCAN
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose	DUNCAN
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;	DUNCAN
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him	DUNCAN
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,	DUNCAN
We are your guest to-night.	DUNCAN
Your servants ever	LADY MACBETH
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,	LADY MACBETH
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,	LADY MACBETH
Still to return your own.	LADY MACBETH
Give me your hand;	DUNCAN
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,	DUNCAN
And shall continue our graces towards him.	DUNCAN
By your leave, hostess.	DUNCAN
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well	MACBETH
It were done quickly: if the assassination	MACBETH
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch	MACBETH
With his surcease success; that but this blow	MACBETH
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,	MACBETH
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,	MACBETH
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases	MACBETH
We still have judgment here; that we but teach	MACBETH
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return	MACBETH
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice	MACBETH
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice	MACBETH
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;	MACBETH
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,	MACBETH
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,	MACBETH
Who should against his murderer shut the door,	MACBETH
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan	MACBETH
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been	MACBETH
So clear in his great office, that his virtues	MACBETH
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against	MACBETH
The deep damnation of his taking-off;	MACBETH
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,	MACBETH
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed	MACBETH
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,	MACBETH
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,	MACBETH
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur	MACBETH
To prick the sides of my intent, but only	MACBETH
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself	MACBETH
And falls on the other.	MACBETH
How now! what news?	MACBETH
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?	LADY MACBETH
Hath he ask'd for me?	MACBETH
Know you not he has?	LADY MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business:	MACBETH
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought	MACBETH
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,	MACBETH
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,	MACBETH
Not cast aside so soon.	MACBETH
Was the hope drunk	LADY MACBETH
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?	LADY MACBETH
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale	LADY MACBETH
At what it did so freely? From this time	LADY MACBETH
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard	LADY MACBETH
To be the same in thine own act and valour	LADY MACBETH
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that	LADY MACBETH
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,	LADY MACBETH
And live a coward in thine own esteem,	LADY MACBETH
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'	LADY MACBETH
Like the poor cat i' the adage?	LADY MACBETH
Prithee, peace:	MACBETH
I dare do all that may become a man;	MACBETH
Who dares do more is none.	MACBETH
What beast was't, then,	LADY MACBETH
That made you break this enterprise to me?	LADY MACBETH
When you durst do it, then you were a man;	LADY MACBETH
And, to be more than what you were, you would	LADY MACBETH
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place	LADY MACBETH
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:	LADY MACBETH
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now	LADY MACBETH
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know	LADY MACBETH
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:	LADY MACBETH
I would, while it was smiling in my face,	LADY MACBETH
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,	LADY MACBETH
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you	LADY MACBETH
Have done to this.	LADY MACBETH
If we should fail?	MACBETH
We fail!	LADY MACBETH
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,	LADY MACBETH
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--	LADY MACBETH
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey	LADY MACBETH
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains	LADY MACBETH
Will I with wine and wassail so convince	LADY MACBETH
That memory, the warder of the brain,	LADY MACBETH
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason	LADY MACBETH
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep	LADY MACBETH
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,	LADY MACBETH
What cannot you and I perform upon	LADY MACBETH
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon	LADY MACBETH
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt	LADY MACBETH
Of our great quell?	LADY MACBETH
Bring forth men-children only;	MACBETH
For thy undaunted mettle should compose	MACBETH
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,	MACBETH
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two	MACBETH
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,	MACBETH
That they have done't?	MACBETH
Who dares receive it other,	LADY MACBETH
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar	LADY MACBETH
Upon his death?	LADY MACBETH
I am settled, and bend up	MACBETH
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.	MACBETH
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:	MACBETH
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.	MACBETH
How goes the night, boy?	BANQUO
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.	FLEANCE
And she goes down at twelve.	BANQUO
I take't, 'tis later, sir.	FLEANCE
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;	BANQUO
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.	BANQUO
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,	BANQUO
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,	BANQUO
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature	BANQUO
Gives way to in repose!	BANQUO
Give me my sword.	BANQUO
Who's there?	BANQUO
A friend.	MACBETH
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:	BANQUO
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and	BANQUO
Sent forth great largess to your offices.	BANQUO
This diamond he greets your wife withal,	BANQUO
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up	BANQUO
In measureless content.	BANQUO
Being unprepared,	MACBETH
Our will became the servant to defect;	MACBETH
Which else should free have wrought.	MACBETH
All's well.	BANQUO
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:	BANQUO
To you they have show'd some truth.	BANQUO
I think not of them:	MACBETH
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,	MACBETH
We would spend it in some words upon that business,	MACBETH
If you would grant the time.	MACBETH
At your kind'st leisure.	BANQUO
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,	MACBETH
It shall make honour for you.	MACBETH
So I lose none	BANQUO
In seeking to augment it, but still keep	BANQUO
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,	BANQUO
I shall be counsell'd.	BANQUO
Good repose the while!	MACBETH
Thanks, sir: the like to you!	BANQUO
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,	MACBETH
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.	MACBETH
Is this a dagger which I see before me,	MACBETH
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.	MACBETH
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.	MACBETH
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible	MACBETH
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but	MACBETH
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,	MACBETH
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	MACBETH
I see thee yet, in form as palpable	MACBETH
As this which now I draw.	MACBETH
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;	MACBETH
And such an instrument I was to use.	MACBETH
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,	MACBETH
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,	MACBETH
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,	MACBETH
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:	MACBETH
It is the bloody business which informs	MACBETH
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld	MACBETH
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse	MACBETH
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates	MACBETH
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,	MACBETH
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,	MACBETH
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.	MACBETH
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design	MACBETH
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,	MACBETH
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear	MACBETH
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	MACBETH
And take the present horror from the time,	MACBETH
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:	MACBETH
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.	MACBETH
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.	MACBETH
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell	MACBETH
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.	MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;	LADY MACBETH
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.	LADY MACBETH
Hark! Peace!	LADY MACBETH
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,	LADY MACBETH
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:	LADY MACBETH
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms	LADY MACBETH
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd	LADY MACBETH
their possets,	LADY MACBETH
That death and nature do contend about them,	LADY MACBETH
Whether they live or die.	LADY MACBETH
[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!	MACBETH
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,	LADY MACBETH
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed	LADY MACBETH
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;	LADY MACBETH
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled	LADY MACBETH
My father as he slept, I had done't.	LADY MACBETH
My husband!	LADY MACBETH
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?	MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.	LADY MACBETH
Did not you speak?	LADY MACBETH
When?	MACBETH
Now.	LADY MACBETH
As I descended?	MACBETH
Ay.	LADY MACBETH
Hark!	MACBETH
Who lies i' the second chamber?	MACBETH
Donalbain.	LADY MACBETH
This is a sorry sight.	MACBETH
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.	LADY MACBETH
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried	MACBETH
'Murder!'	MACBETH
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:	MACBETH
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them	MACBETH
Again to sleep.	MACBETH
There are two lodged together.	LADY MACBETH
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;	MACBETH
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.	MACBETH
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'	MACBETH
When they did say 'God bless us!'	MACBETH
Consider it not so deeply.	LADY MACBETH
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?	MACBETH
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'	MACBETH
Stuck in my throat.	MACBETH
These deeds must not be thought	LADY MACBETH
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.	LADY MACBETH
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!	MACBETH
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,	MACBETH
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,	MACBETH
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,	MACBETH
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,	MACBETH
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--	MACBETH
What do you mean?	LADY MACBETH
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:	MACBETH
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor	MACBETH
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'	MACBETH
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,	LADY MACBETH
You do unbend your noble strength, to think	LADY MACBETH
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,	LADY MACBETH
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.	LADY MACBETH
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?	LADY MACBETH
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear	LADY MACBETH
The sleepy grooms with blood.	LADY MACBETH
I'll go no more:	MACBETH
I am afraid to think what I have done;	MACBETH
Look on't again I dare not.	MACBETH
Infirm of purpose!	LADY MACBETH
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead	LADY MACBETH
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood	LADY MACBETH
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,	LADY MACBETH
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;	LADY MACBETH
For it must seem their guilt.	LADY MACBETH
Whence is that knocking?	MACBETH
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?	MACBETH
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.	MACBETH
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood	MACBETH
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather	MACBETH
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,	MACBETH
Making the green one red.	MACBETH
My hands are of your colour; but I shame	LADY MACBETH
To wear a heart so white.	LADY MACBETH
I hear a knocking	LADY MACBETH
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;	LADY MACBETH
A little water clears us of this deed:	LADY MACBETH
How easy is it, then! Your constancy	LADY MACBETH
Hath left you unattended.	LADY MACBETH
Hark! more knocking.	LADY MACBETH
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,	LADY MACBETH
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost	LADY MACBETH
So poorly in your thoughts.	LADY MACBETH
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.	MACBETH
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!	MACBETH
Here's a knocking indeed! If a	Porter
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have	Porter
old turning the key.	Porter
Knock,	Porter
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of	Porter
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged	Porter
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in	Porter
time; have napkins enow about you; here	Porter
you'll sweat for't.	Porter
Knock,	Porter
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's	Porter
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could	Porter
swear in both the scales against either scale;	Porter
who committed treason enough for God's sake,	Porter
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come	Porter
in, equivocator.	Porter
Knock,	Porter
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an	Porter
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of	Porter
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may	Porter
roast your goose.	Porter
Knock,	Porter
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But	Porter
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter	Porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in	Porter
some of all professions that go the primrose	Porter
way to the everlasting bonfire.	Porter
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.	Porter
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,	MACDUFF
That you do lie so late?	MACDUFF
'Faith sir, we were carousing till the	Porter
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great	Porter
provoker of three things.	Porter
What three things does drink especially provoke?	MACDUFF
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and	Porter
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;	Porter
it provokes the desire, but it takes	Porter
away the performance: therefore, much drink	Porter
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:	Porter
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets	Porter
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,	Porter
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and	Porter
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him	Porter
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.	Porter
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.	MACDUFF
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on	Porter
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I	Porter
think, being too strong for him, though he took	Porter
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast	Porter
him.	Porter
Is thy master stirring?	MACDUFF
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.	MACDUFF
Good morrow, noble sir.	LENNOX
Good morrow, both.	MACBETH
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?	MACDUFF
Not yet.	MACBETH
He did command me to call timely on him:	MACDUFF
I have almost slipp'd the hour.	MACDUFF
I'll bring you to him.	MACBETH
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;	MACDUFF
But yet 'tis one.	MACDUFF
The labour we delight in physics pain.	MACBETH
This is the door.	MACBETH
I'll make so bold to call,	MACDUFF
For 'tis my limited service.	MACDUFF
Goes the king hence to-day?	LENNOX
He does: he did appoint so.	MACBETH
The night has been unruly: where we lay,	LENNOX
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,	LENNOX
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,	LENNOX
And prophesying with accents terrible	LENNOX
Of dire combustion and confused events	LENNOX
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird	LENNOX
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth	LENNOX
Was feverous and did shake.	LENNOX
'Twas a rough night.	MACBETH
My young remembrance cannot parallel	LENNOX
A fellow to it.	LENNOX
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart	MACDUFF
Cannot conceive nor name thee!	MACDUFF
What's the matter.	LENNOX
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!	MACDUFF
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope	MACDUFF
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence	MACDUFF
The life o' the building!	MACDUFF
What is 't you say? the life?	MACBETH
Mean you his majesty?	LENNOX
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight	MACDUFF
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;	MACDUFF
See, and then speak yourselves.	MACDUFF
Awake, awake!	MACDUFF
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!	MACDUFF
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!	MACDUFF
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,	MACDUFF
And look on death itself! up, up, and see	MACDUFF
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!	MACDUFF
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,	MACDUFF
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.	MACDUFF
What's the business,	LADY MACBETH
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley	LADY MACBETH
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!	LADY MACBETH
O gentle lady,	MACDUFF
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:	MACDUFF
The repetition, in a woman's ear,	MACDUFF
Would murder as it fell.	MACDUFF
O Banquo, Banquo,	MACDUFF
Our royal master 's murder'd!	MACDUFF
Woe, alas!	LADY MACBETH
What, in our house?	LADY MACBETH
Too cruel any where.	BANQUO
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,	BANQUO
And say it is not so.	BANQUO
Had I but died an hour before this chance,	MACBETH
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,	MACBETH
There 's nothing serious in mortality:	MACBETH
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;	MACBETH
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees	MACBETH
Is left this vault to brag of.	MACBETH
What is amiss?	DONALBAIN
You are, and do not know't:	MACBETH
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood	MACBETH
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.	MACBETH
Your royal father 's murder'd.	MACDUFF
O, by whom?	MALCOLM
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:	LENNOX
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;	LENNOX
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found	LENNOX
Upon their pillows:	LENNOX
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life	LENNOX
Was to be trusted with them.	LENNOX
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,	MACBETH
That I did kill them.	MACBETH
Wherefore did you so?	MACDUFF
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,	MACBETH
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:	MACBETH
The expedition my violent love	MACBETH
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,	MACBETH
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;	MACBETH
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature	MACBETH
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,	MACBETH
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers	MACBETH
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,	MACBETH
That had a heart to love, and in that heart	MACBETH
Courage to make 's love kno wn?	MACBETH
Help me hence, ho!	LADY MACBETH
Look to the lady.	MACDUFF
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,	MALCOLM
That most may claim this argument for ours?	MALCOLM
[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,	DONALBAIN
where our fate,	DONALBAIN
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?	DONALBAIN
Let 's away;	DONALBAIN
Our tears are not yet brew'd.	DONALBAIN
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Nor our strong sorrow	MALCOLM
Upon the foot of motion.	MALCOLM
Look to the lady:	BANQUO
And when we have our naked frailties hid,	BANQUO
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,	BANQUO
And question this most bloody piece of work,	BANQUO
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:	BANQUO
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence	BANQUO
Against the undivulged pretence I fight	BANQUO
Of treasonous malice.	BANQUO
And so do I.	MACDUFF
So all.	ALL
Let's briefly put on manly readiness,	MACBETH
And meet i' the hall together.	MACBETH
Well contented.	ALL
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:	MALCOLM
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office	MALCOLM
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.	MALCOLM
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune	DONALBAIN
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,	DONALBAIN
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,	DONALBAIN
The nearer bloody.	DONALBAIN
This murderous shaft that's shot	MALCOLM
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way	MALCOLM
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;	MALCOLM
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,	MALCOLM
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft	MALCOLM
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.	MALCOLM
Threescore and ten I can remember well:	Old Man
Within the volume of which time I have seen	Old Man
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night	Old Man
Hath trifled former knowings.	Old Man
Ah, good father,	ROSS
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,	ROSS
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,	ROSS
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:	ROSS
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,	ROSS
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,	ROSS
When living light should kiss it?	ROSS
'Tis unnatural,	Old Man
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,	Old Man
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,	Old Man
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.	Old Man
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--	ROSS
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,	ROSS
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,	ROSS
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make	ROSS
War with mankind.	ROSS
'Tis said they eat each other.	Old Man
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes	ROSS
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.	ROSS
How goes the world, sir, now?	ROSS
Why, see you not?	MACDUFF
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?	ROSS
Those that Macbeth hath slain.	MACDUFF
Alas, the day!	ROSS
What good could they pretend?	ROSS
They were suborn'd:	MACDUFF
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,	MACDUFF
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them	MACDUFF
Suspicion of the deed.	MACDUFF
'Gainst nature still!	ROSS
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up	ROSS
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like	ROSS
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.	ROSS
He is already named, and gone to Scone	MACDUFF
To be invested.	MACDUFF
Where is Duncan's body?	ROSS
Carried to Colmekill,	MACDUFF
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,	MACDUFF
And guardian of their bones.	MACDUFF
Will you to Scone?	ROSS
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.	MACDUFF
Well, I will thither.	ROSS
Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!	MACDUFF
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!	MACDUFF
Farewell, father.	ROSS
God's benison go with you; and with those	Old Man
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!	Old Man
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,	BANQUO
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,	BANQUO
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said	BANQUO
It should not stand in thy posterity,	BANQUO
But that myself should be the root and father	BANQUO
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--	BANQUO
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--	BANQUO
Why, by the verities on thee made good,	BANQUO
May they not be my oracles as well,	BANQUO
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.	BANQUO
Here's our chief guest.	MACBETH
If he had been forgotten,	LADY MACBETH
It had been as a gap in our great feast,	LADY MACBETH
And all-thing unbecoming.	LADY MACBETH
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,	MACBETH
And I'll request your presence.	MACBETH
Let your highness	BANQUO
Command upon me; to the which my duties	BANQUO
Are with a most indissoluble tie	BANQUO
For ever knit.	BANQUO
Ride you this afternoon?	MACBETH
Ay, my good lord.	BANQUO
We should have else desired your good advice,	MACBETH
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,	MACBETH
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.	MACBETH
Is't far you ride?	MACBETH
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time	BANQUO
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,	BANQUO
I must become a borrower of the night	BANQUO
For a dark hour or twain.	BANQUO
Fail not our feast.	MACBETH
My lord, I will not.	BANQUO
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd	MACBETH
In England and in Ireland, not confessing	MACBETH
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers	MACBETH
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,	MACBETH
When therewithal we shall have cause of state	MACBETH
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,	MACBETH
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?	MACBETH
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.	BANQUO
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;	MACBETH
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.	MACBETH
Let every man be master of his time	MACBETH
Till seven at night: to make society	MACBETH
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself	MACBETH
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!	MACBETH
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men	MACBETH
Our pleasure?	MACBETH
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.	ATTENDANT
Bring them before us.	MACBETH
To be thus is nothing;	MACBETH
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo	MACBETH
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature	MACBETH
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;	MACBETH
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,	MACBETH
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour	MACBETH
To act in safety. There is none but he	MACBETH
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,	MACBETH
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,	MACBETH
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters	MACBETH
When first they put the name of king upon me,	MACBETH
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like	MACBETH
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:	MACBETH
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,	MACBETH
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,	MACBETH
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,	MACBETH
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,	MACBETH
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;	MACBETH
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;	MACBETH
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace	MACBETH
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel	MACBETH
Given to the common enemy of man,	MACBETH
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!	MACBETH
Rather than so, come fate into the list.	MACBETH
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!	MACBETH
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.	MACBETH
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?	MACBETH
It was, so please your highness.	First Murderer
Well then, now	MACBETH
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know	MACBETH
That it was he in the times past which held you	MACBETH
So under fortune, which you thought had been	MACBETH
Our innocent self: this I made good to you	MACBETH
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,	MACBETH
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,	MACBETH
the instruments,	MACBETH
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might	MACBETH
To half a soul and to a notion crazed	MACBETH
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'	MACBETH
You made it known to us.	First Murderer
I did so, and went further, which is now	MACBETH
Our point of second meeting. Do you find	MACBETH
Your patience so predominant in your nature	MACBETH
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd	MACBETH
To pray for this good man and for his issue,	MACBETH
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave	MACBETH
And beggar'd yours for ever?	MACBETH
We are men, my liege.	First Murderer
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;	MACBETH
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,	MACBETH
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept	MACBETH
All by the name of dogs: the valued file	MACBETH
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,	MACBETH
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one	MACBETH
According to the gift which bounteous nature	MACBETH
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive	MACBETH
Particular addition. from the bill	MACBETH
That writes them all alike: and so of men.	MACBETH
Now, if you have a station in the file,	MACBETH
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;	MACBETH
And I will put that business in your bosoms,	MACBETH
Whose execution takes your enemy off,	MACBETH
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,	MACBETH
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,	MACBETH
Which in his death were perfect.	MACBETH
I am one, my liege,	Second Murderer
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	Second Murderer
Have so incensed that I am reckless what	Second Murderer
I do to spite the world.	Second Murderer
And I another	First Murderer
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,	First Murderer
That I would set my lie on any chance,	First Murderer
To mend it, or be rid on't.	First Murderer
Both of you	MACBETH
Know Banquo was your enemy.	MACBETH
True, my lord.	Both Murderers
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,	MACBETH
That every minute of his being thrusts	MACBETH
Against my near'st of life: and though I could	MACBETH
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight	MACBETH
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,	MACBETH
For certain friends that are both his and mine,	MACBETH
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall	MACBETH
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,	MACBETH
That I to your assistance do make love,	MACBETH
Masking the business from the common eye	MACBETH
For sundry weighty reasons.	MACBETH
We shall, my lord,	Second Murderer
Perform what you command us.	Second Murderer
Though our lives--	First Murderer
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most	MACBETH
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;	MACBETH
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,	MACBETH
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,	MACBETH
And something from the palace; always thought	MACBETH
That I require a clearness: and with him--	MACBETH
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--	MACBETH
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,	MACBETH
Whose absence is no less material to me	MACBETH
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate	MACBETH
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:	MACBETH
I'll come to you anon.	MACBETH
We are resolved, my lord.	Both Murderers
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.	MACBETH
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,	MACBETH
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.	MACBETH
Is Banquo gone from court?	LADY MACBETH
Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.	Servant
Say to the king, I would attend his leisure	LADY MACBETH
For a few words.	LADY MACBETH
Madam, I will.	Servant
Nought's had, all's spent,	LADY MACBETH
Where our desire is got without content:	LADY MACBETH
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy	LADY MACBETH
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.	LADY MACBETH
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,	LADY MACBETH
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,	LADY MACBETH
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died	LADY MACBETH
With them they think on? Things without all remedy	LADY MACBETH
Should be without regard: what's done is done.	LADY MACBETH
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:	MACBETH
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice	MACBETH
Remains in danger of her former tooth.	MACBETH
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the	MACBETH
worlds suffer,	MACBETH
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep	MACBETH
In the affliction of these terrible dreams	MACBETH
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,	MACBETH
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,	MACBETH
Than on the torture of the mind to lie	MACBETH
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;	MACBETH
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;	MACBETH
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,	MACBETH
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,	MACBETH
Can touch him further.	MACBETH
Come on;	LADY MACBETH
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;	LADY MACBETH
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.	LADY MACBETH
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:	MACBETH
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;	MACBETH
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:	MACBETH
Unsafe the while, that we	MACBETH
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,	MACBETH
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,	MACBETH
Disguising what they are.	MACBETH
You must leave this.	LADY MACBETH
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!	MACBETH
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.	MACBETH
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.	LADY MACBETH
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;	MACBETH
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown	MACBETH
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons	MACBETH
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums	MACBETH
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done	MACBETH
A deed of dreadful note.	MACBETH
What's to be done?	LADY MACBETH
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,	MACBETH
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,	MACBETH
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;	MACBETH
And with thy bloody and invisible hand	MACBETH
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond	MACBETH
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow	MACBETH
Makes wing to the rooky wood:	MACBETH
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;	MACBETH
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.	MACBETH
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;	MACBETH
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.	MACBETH
So, prithee, go with me.	MACBETH
But who did bid thee join with us?	First Murderer
Macbeth.	Third Murderer
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers	Second Murderer
Our offices and what we have to do	Second Murderer
To the direction just.	Second Murderer
Then stand with us.	First Murderer
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:	First Murderer
Now spurs the lated traveller apace	First Murderer
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches	First Murderer
The subject of our watch.	First Murderer
Hark! I hear horses.	Third Murderer
[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!	BANQUO
Then 'tis he: the rest	Second Murderer
That are within the note of expectation	Second Murderer
Already are i' the court.	Second Murderer
His horses go about.	First Murderer
Almost a mile: but he does usually,	Third Murderer
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate	Third Murderer
Make it their walk.	Third Murderer
A light, a light!	Second Murderer
'Tis he.	Third Murderer
Stand to't.	First Murderer
It will be rain to-night.	BANQUO
Let it come down.	First Murderer
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!	BANQUO
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!	BANQUO
Who did strike out the light?	Third Murderer
Wast not the way?	First Murderer
There's but one down; the son is fled.	Third Murderer
We have lost	Second Murderer
Best half of our affair.	Second Murderer
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.	First Murderer
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first	MACBETH
And last the hearty welcome.	MACBETH
Thanks to your majesty.	Lords
Ourself will mingle with society,	MACBETH
And play the humble host.	MACBETH
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time	MACBETH
We will require her welcome.	MACBETH
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;	LADY MACBETH
For my heart speaks they are welcome.	LADY MACBETH
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.	MACBETH
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:	MACBETH
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure	MACBETH
The table round.	MACBETH
There's blood on thy face.	MACBETH
'Tis Banquo's then.	First Murderer
'Tis better thee without than he within.	MACBETH
Is he dispatch'd?	MACBETH
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.	First Murderer
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good	MACBETH
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,	MACBETH
Thou art the nonpareil.	MACBETH
Most royal sir,	First Murderer
Fleance is 'scaped.	First Murderer
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,	MACBETH
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,	MACBETH
As broad and general as the casing air:	MACBETH
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in	MACBETH
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?	MACBETH
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,	First Murderer
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;	First Murderer
The least a death to nature.	First Murderer
Thanks for that:	MACBETH
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled	MACBETH
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,	MACBETH
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow	MACBETH
We'll hear, ourselves, again.	MACBETH
My royal lord,	LADY MACBETH
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold	LADY MACBETH
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,	LADY MACBETH
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;	LADY MACBETH
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;	LADY MACBETH
Meeting were bare without it.	LADY MACBETH
Sweet remembrancer!	MACBETH
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,	MACBETH
And health on both!	MACBETH
May't please your highness sit.	LENNOX
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,	MACBETH
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;	MACBETH
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness	MACBETH
Than pity for mischance!	MACBETH
His absence, sir,	ROSS
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness	ROSS
To grace us with your royal company.	ROSS
The table's full.	MACBETH
Here is a place reserved, sir.	LENNOX
Where?	MACBETH
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?	LENNOX
Which of you have done this?	MACBETH
What, my good lord?	Lords
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake	MACBETH
Thy gory locks at me.	MACBETH
Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.	ROSS
Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,	LADY MACBETH
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;	LADY MACBETH
The fit is momentary; upon a thought	LADY MACBETH
He will again be well: if much you note him,	LADY MACBETH
You shall offend him and extend his passion:	LADY MACBETH
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?	LADY MACBETH
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that	MACBETH
Which might appal the devil.	MACBETH
O proper stuff!	LADY MACBETH
This is the very painting of your fear:	LADY MACBETH
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,	LADY MACBETH
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,	LADY MACBETH
Impostors to true fear, would well become	LADY MACBETH
A woman's story at a winter's fire,	LADY MACBETH
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!	LADY MACBETH
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,	LADY MACBETH
You look but on a stool.	LADY MACBETH
Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!	MACBETH
how say you?	MACBETH
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.	MACBETH
If charnel-houses and our graves must send	MACBETH
Those that we bury back, our monuments	MACBETH
Shall be the maws of kites.	MACBETH
What, quite unmann'd in folly?	LADY MACBETH
If I stand here, I saw him.	MACBETH
Fie, for shame!	LADY MACBETH
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,	MACBETH
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;	MACBETH
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd	MACBETH
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,	MACBETH
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,	MACBETH
And there an end; but now they rise again,	MACBETH
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,	MACBETH
And push us from our stools: this is more strange	MACBETH
Than such a murder is.	MACBETH
My worthy lord,	LADY MACBETH
Your noble friends do lack you.	LADY MACBETH
I do forget.	MACBETH
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,	MACBETH
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing	MACBETH
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;	MACBETH
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.	MACBETH
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,	MACBETH
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;	MACBETH
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,	MACBETH
And all to all.	MACBETH
Our duties, and the pledge.	Lords
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!	MACBETH
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;	MACBETH
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes	MACBETH
Which thou dost glare with!	MACBETH
Think of this, good peers,	LADY MACBETH
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;	LADY MACBETH
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.	LADY MACBETH
What man dare, I dare:	MACBETH
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,	MACBETH
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;	MACBETH
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves	MACBETH
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,	MACBETH
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;	MACBETH
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me	MACBETH
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!	MACBETH
Unreal mockery, hence!	MACBETH
Why, so: being gone,	MACBETH
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.	MACBETH
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,	LADY MACBETH
With most admired disorder.	LADY MACBETH
Can such things be,	MACBETH
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,	MACBETH
Without our special wonder? You make me strange	MACBETH
Even to the disposition that I owe,	MACBETH
When now I think you can behold such sights,	MACBETH
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,	MACBETH
When mine is blanched with fear.	MACBETH
What sights, my lord?	ROSS
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;	LADY MACBETH
Question enrages him. At once, good night:	LADY MACBETH
Stand not upon the order of your going,	LADY MACBETH
But go at once.	LADY MACBETH
Good night; and better health	LENNOX
Attend his majesty!	LENNOX
A kind good night to all!	LADY MACBETH
It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:	MACBETH
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;	MACBETH
Augurs and understood relations have	MACBETH
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth	MACBETH
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?	MACBETH
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.	LADY MACBETH
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person	MACBETH
At our great bidding?	MACBETH
Did you send to him, sir?	LADY MACBETH
I hear it by the way; but I will send:	MACBETH
There's not a one of them but in his house	MACBETH
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,	MACBETH
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:	MACBETH
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,	MACBETH
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,	MACBETH
All causes shall give way: I am in blood	MACBETH
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,	MACBETH
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:	MACBETH
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;	MACBETH
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.	MACBETH
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.	LADY MACBETH
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse	MACBETH
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:	MACBETH
We are yet but young in deed.	MACBETH
Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.	First Witch
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,	HECATE
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare	HECATE
To trade and traffic with Macbeth	HECATE
In riddles and affairs of death;	HECATE
And I, the mistress of your charms,	HECATE
The close contriver of all harms,	HECATE
Was never call'd to bear my part,	HECATE
Or show the glory of our art?	HECATE
And, which is worse, all you have done	HECATE
Hath been but for a wayward son,	HECATE
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,	HECATE
Loves for his own ends, not for you.	HECATE
But make amends now: get you gone,	HECATE
And at the pit of Acheron	HECATE
Meet me i' the morning: thither he	HECATE
Will come to know his destiny:	HECATE
Your vessels and your spells provide,	HECATE
Your charms and every thing beside.	HECATE
I am for the air; this night I'll spend	HECATE
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:	HECATE
Great business must be wrought ere noon:	HECATE
Upon the corner of the moon	HECATE
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;	HECATE
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:	HECATE
And that distill'd by magic sleights	HECATE
Shall raise such artificial sprites	HECATE
As by the strength of their illusion	HECATE
Shall draw him on to his confusion:	HECATE
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear	HECATE
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:	HECATE
And you all know, security	HECATE
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.	HECATE
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,	HECATE
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.	HECATE
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.	First Witch
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,	LENNOX
Which can interpret further: only, I say,	LENNOX
Things have been strangely borne. The	LENNOX
gracious Duncan	LENNOX
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:	LENNOX
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;	LENNOX
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,	LENNOX
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.	LENNOX
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous	LENNOX
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain	LENNOX
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!	LENNOX
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight	LENNOX
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,	LENNOX
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?	LENNOX
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;	LENNOX
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive	LENNOX
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	LENNOX
He has borne all things well: and I do think	LENNOX
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--	LENNOX
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they	LENNOX
should find	LENNOX
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.	LENNOX
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd	LENNOX
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear	LENNOX
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell	LENNOX
Where he bestows himself?	LENNOX
The son of Duncan,	Lord
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth	Lord
Lives in the English court, and is received	Lord
Of the most pious Edward with such grace	Lord
That the malevolence of fortune nothing	Lord
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff	Lord
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid	Lord
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:	Lord
That, by the help of these--with Him above	Lord
To ratify the work--we may again	Lord
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,	Lord
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,	Lord
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:	Lord
All which we pine for now: and this report	Lord
Hath so exasperate the king that he	Lord
Prepares for some attempt of war.	Lord
Sent he to Macduff?	LENNOX
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'	Lord
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,	Lord
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time	Lord
That clogs me with this answer.'	Lord
And that well might	LENNOX
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance	LENNOX
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel	LENNOX
Fly to the court of England and unfold	LENNOX
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing	LENNOX
May soon return to this our suffering country	LENNOX
Under a hand accursed!	LENNOX
I'll send my prayers with him.	Lord
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.	First Witch
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.	Second Witch
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.	Third Witch
Round about the cauldron go;	First Witch
In the poison'd entrails throw.	First Witch
Toad, that under cold stone	First Witch
Days and nights has thirty-one	First Witch
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,	First Witch
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.	First Witch
Double, double toil and trouble;	ALL
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.	ALL
Fillet of a fenny snake,	Second Witch
In the cauldron boil and bake;	Second Witch
Eye of newt and toe of frog,	Second Witch
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,	Second Witch
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,	Second Witch
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,	Second Witch
For a charm of powerful trouble,	Second Witch
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.	Second Witch
Double, double toil and trouble;	ALL
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	ALL
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,	Third Witch
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf	Third Witch
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,	Third Witch
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,	Third Witch
Liver of blaspheming Jew,	Third Witch
Gall of goat, and slips of yew	Third Witch
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,	Third Witch
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,	Third Witch
Finger of birth-strangled babe	Third Witch
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,	Third Witch
Make the gruel thick and slab:	Third Witch
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,	Third Witch
For the ingredients of our cauldron.	Third Witch
Double, double toil and trouble;	ALL
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	ALL
Cool it with a baboon's blood,	Second Witch
Then the charm is firm and good.	Second Witch
O well done! I commend your pains;	HECATE
And every one shall share i' the gains;	HECATE
And now about the cauldron sing,	HECATE
Live elves and fairies in a ring,	HECATE
Enchanting all that you put in.	HECATE
By the pricking of my thumbs,	Second Witch
Something wicked this way comes.	Second Witch
Open, locks,	Second Witch
Whoever knocks!	Second Witch
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!	MACBETH
What is't you do?	MACBETH
A deed without a name.	ALL
I conjure you, by that which you profess,	MACBETH
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:	MACBETH
Though you untie the winds and let them fight	MACBETH
Against the churches; though the yesty waves	MACBETH
Confound and swallow navigation up;	MACBETH
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;	MACBETH
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;	MACBETH
Though palaces and pyramids do slope	MACBETH
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure	MACBETH
Of nature's germens tumble all together,	MACBETH
Even till destruction sicken; answer me	MACBETH
To what I ask you.	MACBETH
Speak.	First Witch
Demand.	Second Witch
We'll answer.	Third Witch
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,	First Witch
Or from our masters?	First Witch
Call 'em; let me see 'em.	MACBETH
Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten	First Witch
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten	First Witch
From the murderer's gibbet throw	First Witch
Into the flame.	First Witch
Come, high or low;	ALL
Thyself and office deftly show!	ALL
Tell me, thou unknown power,--	MACBETH
He knows thy thought:	First Witch
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.	First Witch
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;	First Apparition
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.	First Apparition
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;	MACBETH
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one	MACBETH
word more,--	MACBETH
He will not be commanded: here's another,	First Witch
More potent than the first.	First Witch
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!	Second Apparition
Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.	MACBETH
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn	Second Apparition
The power of man, for none of woman born	Second Apparition
Shall harm Macbeth.	Second Apparition
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?	MACBETH
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,	MACBETH
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;	MACBETH
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,	MACBETH
And sleep in spite of thunder.	MACBETH
What is this	MACBETH
That rises like the issue of a king,	MACBETH
And wears upon his baby-brow the round	MACBETH
And top of sovereignty?	MACBETH
Listen, but speak not to't.	ALL
Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care	Third Apparition
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:	Third Apparition
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until	Third Apparition
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill	Third Apparition
Shall come against him.	Third Apparition
That will never be	MACBETH
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree	MACBETH
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!	MACBETH
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood	MACBETH
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth	MACBETH
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath	MACBETH
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart	MACBETH
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art	MACBETH
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever	MACBETH
Reign in this kingdom?	MACBETH
Seek to know no more.	ALL
I will be satisfied: deny me this,	MACBETH
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.	MACBETH
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?	MACBETH
Show!	First Witch
Show!	Second Witch
Show!	Third Witch
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;	ALL
Come like shadows, so depart!	ALL
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!	MACBETH
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,	MACBETH
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.	MACBETH
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!	MACBETH
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!	MACBETH
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?	MACBETH
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:	MACBETH
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass	MACBETH
Which shows me many more; and some I see	MACBETH
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:	MACBETH
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;	MACBETH
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,	MACBETH
And points at them for his.	MACBETH
What, is this so?	MACBETH
Ay, sir, all this is so: but why	First Witch
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?	First Witch
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,	First Witch
And show the best of our delights:	First Witch
I'll charm the air to give a sound,	First Witch
While you perform your antic round:	First Witch
That this great king may kindly say,	First Witch
Our duties did his welcome pay.	First Witch
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour	MACBETH
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!	MACBETH
Come in, without there!	MACBETH
What's your grace's will?	LENNOX
Saw you the weird sisters?	MACBETH
No, my lord.	LENNOX
Came they not by you?	MACBETH
No, indeed, my lord.	LENNOX
Infected be the air whereon they ride;	MACBETH
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear	MACBETH
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?	MACBETH
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word	LENNOX
Macduff is fled to England.	LENNOX
Fled to England!	MACBETH
Ay, my good lord.	LENNOX
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:	MACBETH
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook	MACBETH
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment	MACBETH
The very firstlings of my heart shall be	MACBETH
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,	MACBETH
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:	MACBETH
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;	MACBETH
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword	MACBETH
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls	MACBETH
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;	MACBETH
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.	MACBETH
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?	MACBETH
Come, bring me where they are.	MACBETH
What had he done, to make him fly the land?	LADY MACDUFF
You must have patience, madam.	ROSS
He had none:	LADY MACDUFF
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,	LADY MACDUFF
Our fears do make us traitors.	LADY MACDUFF
You know not	ROSS
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.	ROSS
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,	LADY MACDUFF
His mansion and his titles in a place	LADY MACDUFF
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;	LADY MACDUFF
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,	LADY MACDUFF
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,	LADY MACDUFF
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.	LADY MACDUFF
All is the fear and nothing is the love;	LADY MACDUFF
As little is the wisdom, where the flight	LADY MACDUFF
So runs against all reason.	LADY MACDUFF
My dearest coz,	ROSS
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,	ROSS
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows	ROSS
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak	ROSS
much further;	ROSS
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors	ROSS
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour	ROSS
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,	ROSS
But float upon a wild and violent sea	ROSS
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:	ROSS
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:	ROSS
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward	ROSS
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,	ROSS
Blessing upon you!	ROSS
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.	LADY MACDUFF
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,	ROSS
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:	ROSS
I take my leave at once.	ROSS
Sirrah, your father's dead;	LADY MACDUFF
And what will you do now? How will you live?	LADY MACDUFF
As birds do, mother.	Son
What, with worms and flies?	LADY MACDUFF
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.	Son
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,	LADY MACDUFF
The pitfall nor the gin.	LADY MACDUFF
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.	Son
My father is not dead, for all your saying.	Son
Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?	LADY MACDUFF
Nay, how will you do for a husband?	Son
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.	LADY MACDUFF
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.	Son
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,	LADY MACDUFF
With wit enough for thee.	LADY MACDUFF
Was my father a traitor, mother?	Son
Ay, that he was.	LADY MACDUFF
What is a traitor?	Son
Why, one that swears and lies.	LADY MACDUFF
And be all traitors that do so?	Son
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.	LADY MACDUFF
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?	Son
Every one.	LADY MACDUFF
Who must hang them?	Son
Why,  the honest men.	LADY MACDUFF
Then the liars and swearers are fools,	Son
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat	Son
the honest men and hang up them.	Son
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!	LADY MACDUFF
But how wilt thou do for a father?	LADY MACDUFF
If he were dead, you'ld weep for	Son
him: if you would not, it were a good sign	Son
that I should quickly have a new father.	Son
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!	LADY MACDUFF
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,	Messenger
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.	Messenger
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:	Messenger
If you will take a homely man's advice,	Messenger
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.	Messenger
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;	Messenger
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,	Messenger
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!	Messenger
I dare abide no longer.	Messenger
Whither should I fly?	LADY MACDUFF
I have done no harm. But I remember now	LADY MACDUFF
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm	LADY MACDUFF
Is often laudable, to do good sometime	LADY MACDUFF
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,	LADY MACDUFF
Do I put up that womanly defence,	LADY MACDUFF
To say I have done no harm?	LADY MACDUFF
What are these faces?	LADY MACDUFF
Where is your husband?	First Murderer
I hope, in no place so unsanctified	LADY MACDUFF
Where such as thou mayst find him.	LADY MACDUFF
He's a traitor.	First Murderer
Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!	Son
What, you egg!	First Murderer
Young fry of treachery!	First Murderer
He has kill'd me, mother:	Son
Run away, I pray you!	Son
Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there	MALCOLM
Weep our sad bosoms empty.	MALCOLM
Let us rather	MACDUFF
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men	MACDUFF
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn	MACDUFF
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows	MACDUFF
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds	MACDUFF
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out	MACDUFF
Like syllable of dolour.	MACDUFF
What I believe I'll wail,	MALCOLM
What know believe, and what I can redress,	MALCOLM
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.	MALCOLM
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.	MALCOLM
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,	MALCOLM
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.	MALCOLM
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;	MALCOLM
but something	MALCOLM
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom	MALCOLM
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb	MALCOLM
To appease an angry god.	MALCOLM
I am not treacherous.	MACDUFF
But Macbeth is.	MALCOLM
A good and virtuous nature may recoil	MALCOLM
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave	MALCOLM
your pardon;	MALCOLM
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:	MALCOLM
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;	MALCOLM
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,	MALCOLM
Yet grace must still look so.	MALCOLM
I have lost my hopes.	MACDUFF
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.	MALCOLM
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,	MALCOLM
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,	MALCOLM
Without leave-taking? I pray you,	MALCOLM
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,	MALCOLM
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,	MALCOLM
Whatever I shall think.	MALCOLM
Bleed, bleed, poor country!	MACDUFF
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,	MACDUFF
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou	MACDUFF
thy wrongs;	MACDUFF
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:	MACDUFF
I would not be the villain that thou think'st	MACDUFF
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,	MACDUFF
And the rich East to boot.	MACDUFF
Be not offended:	MALCOLM
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	MALCOLM
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;	MALCOLM
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash	MALCOLM
Is added to her wounds: I think withal	MALCOLM
There would be hands uplifted in my right;	MALCOLM
And here from gracious England have I offer	MALCOLM
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,	MALCOLM
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,	MALCOLM
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country	MALCOLM
Shall have more vices than it had before,	MALCOLM
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,	MALCOLM
By him that shall succeed.	MALCOLM
What should he be?	MACDUFF
It is myself I mean: in whom I know	MALCOLM
All the particulars of vice so grafted	MALCOLM
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth	MALCOLM
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state	MALCOLM
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared	MALCOLM
With my confineless harms.	MALCOLM
Not in the legions	MACDUFF
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd	MACDUFF
In evils to top Macbeth.	MACDUFF
I grant him bloody,	MALCOLM
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,	MALCOLM
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin	MALCOLM
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,	MALCOLM
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,	MALCOLM
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up	MALCOLM
The cistern of my lust, and my desire	MALCOLM
All continent impediments would o'erbear	MALCOLM
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth	MALCOLM
Than such an one to reign.	MALCOLM
Boundless intemperance	MACDUFF
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been	MACDUFF
The untimely emptying of the happy throne	MACDUFF
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet	MACDUFF
To take upon you what is yours: you may	MACDUFF
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,	MACDUFF
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.	MACDUFF
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be	MACDUFF
That vulture in you, to devour so many	MACDUFF
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,	MACDUFF
Finding it so inclined.	MACDUFF
With this there grows	MALCOLM
In my most ill-composed affection such	MALCOLM
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,	MALCOLM
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,	MALCOLM
Desire his jewels and this other's house:	MALCOLM
And my more-having would be as a sauce	MALCOLM
To make me hunger more; that I should forge	MALCOLM
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,	MALCOLM
Destroying them for wealth.	MALCOLM
This avarice	MACDUFF
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root	MACDUFF
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been	MACDUFF
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;	MACDUFF
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.	MACDUFF
Of your mere own: all these are portable,	MACDUFF
With other graces weigh'd.	MACDUFF
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,	MALCOLM
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,	MALCOLM
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,	MALCOLM
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,	MALCOLM
I have no relish of them, but abound	MALCOLM
In the division of each several crime,	MALCOLM
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should	MALCOLM
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,	MALCOLM
Uproar the universal peace, confound	MALCOLM
All unity on earth.	MALCOLM
O Scotland, Scotland!	MACDUFF
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:	MALCOLM
I am as I have spoken.	MALCOLM
Fit to govern!	MACDUFF
No, not to live. O nation miserable,	MACDUFF
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,	MACDUFF
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,	MACDUFF
Since that the truest issue of thy throne	MACDUFF
By his own interdiction stands accursed,	MACDUFF
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father	MACDUFF
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,	MACDUFF
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,	MACDUFF
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!	MACDUFF
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself	MACDUFF
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,	MACDUFF
Thy hope ends here!	MACDUFF
Macduff, this noble passion,	MALCOLM
Child of integrity, hath from my soul	MALCOLM
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts	MALCOLM
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth	MALCOLM
By many of these trains hath sought to win me	MALCOLM
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me	MALCOLM
From over-credulous haste: but God above	MALCOLM
Deal between thee and me! for even now	MALCOLM
I put myself to thy direction, and	MALCOLM
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure	MALCOLM
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,	MALCOLM
For strangers to my nature. I am yet	MALCOLM
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,	MALCOLM
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,	MALCOLM
At no time broke my faith, would not betray	MALCOLM
The devil to his fellow and delight	MALCOLM
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking	MALCOLM
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,	MALCOLM
Is thine and my poor country's to command:	MALCOLM
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,	MALCOLM
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,	MALCOLM
Already at a point, was setting forth.	MALCOLM
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness	MALCOLM
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?	MALCOLM
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once	MACDUFF
'Tis hard to reconcile.	MACDUFF
Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?	MALCOLM
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls	Doctor
That stay his cure: their malady convinces	Doctor
The great assay of art; but at his touch--	Doctor
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--	Doctor
They presently amend.	Doctor
I thank you, doctor.	MALCOLM
What's the disease he means?	MACDUFF
'Tis call'd the evil:	MALCOLM
A most miraculous work in this good king;	MALCOLM
Which often, since my here-remain in England,	MALCOLM
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,	MALCOLM
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,	MALCOLM
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,	MALCOLM
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,	MALCOLM
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,	MALCOLM
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,	MALCOLM
To the succeeding royalty he leaves	MALCOLM
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,	MALCOLM
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,	MALCOLM
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,	MALCOLM
That speak him full of grace.	MALCOLM
See, who comes here?	MACDUFF
My countryman; but yet I know him not.	MALCOLM
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.	MACDUFF
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove	MALCOLM
The means that makes us strangers!	MALCOLM
Sir, amen.	ROSS
Stands Scotland where it did?	MACDUFF
Alas, poor country!	ROSS
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot	ROSS
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,	ROSS
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;	ROSS
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air	ROSS
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems	ROSS
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell	ROSS
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives	ROSS
Expire before the flowers in their caps,	ROSS
Dying or ere they sicken.	ROSS
O, relation	MACDUFF
Too nice, and yet too true!	MACDUFF
What's the newest grief?	MALCOLM
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:	ROSS
Each minute teems a new one.	ROSS
How does my wife?	MACDUFF
Why, well.	ROSS
And all my children?	MACDUFF
Well too.	ROSS
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?	MACDUFF
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.	ROSS
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?	MACDUFF
When I came hither to transport the tidings,	ROSS
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour	ROSS
Of many worthy fellows that were out;	ROSS
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,	ROSS
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:	ROSS
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland	ROSS
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,	ROSS
To doff their dire distresses.	ROSS
Be't their comfort	MALCOLM
We are coming thither: gracious England hath	MALCOLM
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;	MALCOLM
An older and a better soldier none	MALCOLM
That Christendom gives out.	MALCOLM
Would I could answer	ROSS
This comfort with the like! But I have words	ROSS
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,	ROSS
Where hearing should not latch them.	ROSS
What concern they?	MACDUFF
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief	MACDUFF
Due to some single breast?	MACDUFF
No mind that's honest	ROSS
But in it shares some woe; though the main part	ROSS
Pertains to you alone.	ROSS
If it be mine,	MACDUFF
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.	MACDUFF
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,	ROSS
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound	ROSS
That ever yet they heard.	ROSS
Hum! I guess at it.	MACDUFF
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes	ROSS
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,	ROSS
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,	ROSS
To add the death of you.	ROSS
Merciful heaven!	MALCOLM
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;	MALCOLM
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak	MALCOLM
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.	MALCOLM
My children too?	MACDUFF
Wife, children, servants, all	ROSS
That could be found.	ROSS
And I must be from thence!	MACDUFF
My wife kill'd too?	MACDUFF
I have said.	ROSS
Be comforted:	MALCOLM
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,	MALCOLM
To cure this deadly grief.	MALCOLM
He has no children. All my pretty ones?	MACDUFF
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?	MACDUFF
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam	MACDUFF
At one fell swoop?	MACDUFF
Dispute it like a man.	MALCOLM
I shall do so;	MACDUFF
But I must also feel it as a man:	MACDUFF
I cannot but remember such things were,	MACDUFF
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,	MACDUFF
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,	MACDUFF
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,	MACDUFF
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,	MACDUFF
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!	MACDUFF
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief	MALCOLM
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.	MALCOLM
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes	MACDUFF
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,	MACDUFF
Cut short all intermission; front to front	MACDUFF
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;	MACDUFF
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,	MACDUFF
Heaven forgive him too!	MACDUFF
This tune goes manly.	MALCOLM
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;	MALCOLM
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth	MALCOLM
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above	MALCOLM
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:	MALCOLM
The night is long that never finds the day.	MALCOLM
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive	Doctor
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?	Doctor
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen	Gentlewoman
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon	Gentlewoman
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,	Gentlewoman
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again	Gentlewoman
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	Gentlewoman
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once	Doctor
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of	Doctor
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her	Doctor
walking and other actual performances, what, at any	Doctor
time, have you heard her say?	Doctor
That, sir, which I will not report after her.	Gentlewoman
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.	Doctor
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to	Gentlewoman
confirm my speech.	Gentlewoman
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;	Gentlewoman
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.	Gentlewoman
How came she by that light?	Doctor
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her	Gentlewoman
continually; 'tis her command.	Gentlewoman
You see, her eyes are open.	Doctor
Ay, but their sense is shut.	Gentlewoman
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.	Doctor
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus	Gentlewoman
washing her hands: I have known her continue in	Gentlewoman
this a quarter of an hour.	Gentlewoman
Yet here's a spot.	LADY MACBETH
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from	Doctor
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.	Doctor
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,	LADY MACBETH
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my	LADY MACBETH
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we	LADY MACBETH
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to	LADY MACBETH
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man	LADY MACBETH
to have had so much blood in him.	LADY MACBETH
Do you mark that?	Doctor
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--	LADY MACBETH
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'	LADY MACBETH
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with	LADY MACBETH
this starting.	LADY MACBETH
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.	Doctor
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of	Gentlewoman
that: heaven knows what she has known.	Gentlewoman
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the	LADY MACBETH
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little	LADY MACBETH
hand. Oh, oh, oh!	LADY MACBETH
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.	Doctor
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the	Gentlewoman
dignity of the whole body.	Gentlewoman
Well, well, well,--	Doctor
Pray God it be, sir.	Gentlewoman
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known	Doctor
those which have walked in their sleep who have died	Doctor
holily in their beds.	Doctor
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so	LADY MACBETH
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he	LADY MACBETH
cannot come out on's grave.	LADY MACBETH
Even so?	Doctor
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:	LADY MACBETH
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's	LADY MACBETH
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!	LADY MACBETH
Will she go now to bed?	Doctor
Directly.	Gentlewoman
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds	Doctor
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds	Doctor
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:	Doctor
More needs she the divine than the physician.	Doctor
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;	Doctor
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,	Doctor
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:	Doctor
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.	Doctor
I think, but dare not speak.	Doctor
Good night, good doctor.	Gentlewoman
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,	MENTEITH
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:	MENTEITH
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes	MENTEITH
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm	MENTEITH
Excite the mortified man.	MENTEITH
Near Birnam wood	ANGUS
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.	ANGUS
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?	CAITHNESS
For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file	LENNOX
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,	LENNOX
And many unrough youths that even now	LENNOX
Protest their first of manhood.	LENNOX
What does the tyrant?	MENTEITH
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:	CAITHNESS
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him	CAITHNESS
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,	CAITHNESS
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause	CAITHNESS
Within the belt of rule.	CAITHNESS
Now does he feel	ANGUS
His secret murders sticking on his hands;	ANGUS
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;	ANGUS
Those he commands move only in command,	ANGUS
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title	ANGUS
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe	ANGUS
Upon a dwarfish thief.	ANGUS
Who then shall blame	MENTEITH
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,	MENTEITH
When all that is within him does condemn	MENTEITH
Itself for being there?	MENTEITH
Well, march we on,	CAITHNESS
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:	CAITHNESS
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,	CAITHNESS
And with him pour we in our country's purge	CAITHNESS
Each drop of us.	CAITHNESS
Or so much as it needs,	LENNOX
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.	LENNOX
Make we our march towards Birnam.	LENNOX
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:	MACBETH
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,	MACBETH
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?	MACBETH
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know	MACBETH
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:	MACBETH
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman	MACBETH
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,	MACBETH
false thanes,	MACBETH
And mingle with the English epicures:	MACBETH
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear	MACBETH
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.	MACBETH
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!	MACBETH
Where got'st thou that goose look?	MACBETH
There is ten thousand--	Servant
Geese, villain!	MACBETH
Soldiers, sir.	Servant
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,	MACBETH
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?	MACBETH
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine	MACBETH
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?	MACBETH
The English force, so please you.	Servant
Take thy face hence.	MACBETH
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,	MACBETH
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push	MACBETH
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.	MACBETH
I have lived long enough: my way of life	MACBETH
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;	MACBETH
And that which should accompany old age,	MACBETH
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,	MACBETH
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,	MACBETH
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,	MACBETH
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!	MACBETH
What is your gracious pleasure?	SEYTON
What news more?	MACBETH
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.	SEYTON
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.	MACBETH
Give me my armour.	MACBETH
'Tis not needed yet.	SEYTON
I'll put it on.	MACBETH
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;	MACBETH
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.	MACBETH
How does your patient, doctor?	MACBETH
Not so sick, my lord,	Doctor
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,	Doctor
That keep her from her rest.	Doctor
Cure her of that.	MACBETH
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,	MACBETH
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,	MACBETH
Raze out the written troubles of the brain	MACBETH
And with some sweet oblivious antidote	MACBETH
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff	MACBETH
Which weighs upon the heart?	MACBETH
Therein the patient	Doctor
Must minister to himself.	Doctor
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.	MACBETH
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.	MACBETH
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.	MACBETH
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast	MACBETH
The water of my land, find her disease,	MACBETH
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,	MACBETH
I would applaud thee to the very echo,	MACBETH
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--	MACBETH
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,	MACBETH
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?	MACBETH
Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation	Doctor
Makes us hear something.	Doctor
Bring it after me.	MACBETH
I will not be afraid of death and bane,	MACBETH
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.	MACBETH
[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,	Doctor
Profit again should hardly draw me here.	Doctor
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand	MALCOLM
That chambers will be safe.	MALCOLM
We doubt it nothing.	MENTEITH
What wood is this before us?	SIWARD
The wood of Birnam.	MENTEITH
Let every soldier hew him down a bough	MALCOLM
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow	MALCOLM
The numbers of our host and make discovery	MALCOLM
Err in report of us.	MALCOLM
It shall be done.	Soldiers
We learn no other but the confident tyrant	SIWARD
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure	SIWARD
Our setting down before 't.	SIWARD
'Tis his main hope:	MALCOLM
For where there is advantage to be given,	MALCOLM
Both more and less have given him the revolt,	MALCOLM
And none serve with him but constrained things	MALCOLM
Whose hearts are absent too.	MALCOLM
Let our just censures	MACDUFF
Attend the true event, and put we on	MACDUFF
Industrious soldiership.	MACDUFF
The time approaches	SIWARD
That will with due decision make us know	SIWARD
What we shall say we have and what we owe.	SIWARD
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,	SIWARD
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:	SIWARD
Towards which advance the war.	SIWARD
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;	MACBETH
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength	MACBETH
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie	MACBETH
Till famine and the ague eat them up:	MACBETH
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,	MACBETH
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,	MACBETH
And beat them backward home.	MACBETH
What is that noise?	MACBETH
It is the cry of women, my good lord.	SEYTON
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;	MACBETH
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd	MACBETH
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair	MACBETH
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir	MACBETH
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;	MACBETH
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts	MACBETH
Cannot once start me.	MACBETH
Wherefore was that cry?	MACBETH
The queen, my lord, is dead.	SEYTON
She should have died hereafter;	MACBETH
There would have been a time for such a word.	MACBETH
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,	MACBETH
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day	MACBETH
To the last syllable of recorded time,	MACBETH
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools	MACBETH
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!	MACBETH
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player	MACBETH
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage	MACBETH
And then is heard no more: it is a tale	MACBETH
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,	MACBETH
Signifying nothing.	MACBETH
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.	MACBETH
Gracious my lord,	Messenger
I should report that which I say I saw,	Messenger
But know not how to do it.	Messenger
Well, say, sir.	MACBETH
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,	Messenger
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,	Messenger
The wood began to move.	Messenger
Liar and slave!	MACBETH
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:	Messenger
Within this three mile may you see it coming;	Messenger
I say, a moving grove.	Messenger
If thou speak'st false,	MACBETH
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,	MACBETH
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,	MACBETH
I care not if thou dost for me as much.	MACBETH
I pull in resolution, and begin	MACBETH
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend	MACBETH
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood	MACBETH
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood	MACBETH
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!	MACBETH
If this which he avouches does appear,	MACBETH
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.	MACBETH
I gin to be aweary of the sun,	MACBETH
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.	MACBETH
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!	MACBETH
At least we'll die with harness on our back.	MACBETH
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.	MALCOLM
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,	MALCOLM
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,	MALCOLM
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we	MALCOLM
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,	MALCOLM
According to our order.	MALCOLM
Fare you well.	SIWARD
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,	SIWARD
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.	SIWARD
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,	MACDUFF
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.	MACDUFF
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,	MACBETH
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he	MACBETH
That was not born of woman? Such a one	MACBETH
Am I to fear, or none.	MACBETH
What is thy name?	YOUNG SIWARD
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.	MACBETH
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name	YOUNG SIWARD
Than any is in hell.	YOUNG SIWARD
My name's Macbeth.	MACBETH
The devil himself could not pronounce a title	YOUNG SIWARD
More hateful to mine ear.	YOUNG SIWARD
No, nor more fearful.	MACBETH
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword	YOUNG SIWARD
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	YOUNG SIWARD
Thou wast born of woman	MACBETH
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,	MACBETH
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.	MACBETH
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!	MACDUFF
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,	MACDUFF
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.	MACDUFF
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms	MACDUFF
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,	MACDUFF
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge	MACDUFF
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;	MACDUFF
By this great clatter, one of greatest note	MACDUFF
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!	MACDUFF
And more I beg not.	MACDUFF
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:	SIWARD
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;	SIWARD
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;	SIWARD
The day almost itself professes yours,	SIWARD
And little is to do.	SIWARD
We have met with foes	MALCOLM
That strike beside us.	MALCOLM
Enter, sir, the castle.	SIWARD
Why should I play the Roman fool, and die	MACBETH
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes	MACBETH
Do better upon them.	MACBETH
Turn, hell-hound, turn!	MACDUFF
Of all men else I have avoided thee:	MACBETH
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged	MACBETH
With blood of thine already.	MACBETH
I have no words:	MACDUFF
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain	MACDUFF
Than terms can give thee out!	MACDUFF
Thou losest labour:	MACBETH
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air	MACBETH
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:	MACBETH
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;	MACBETH
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,	MACBETH
To one of woman born.	MACBETH
Despair thy charm;	MACDUFF
And let the angel whom thou still hast served	MACDUFF
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb	MACDUFF
Untimely ripp'd.	MACDUFF
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,	MACBETH
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!	MACBETH
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,	MACBETH
That palter with us in a double sense;	MACBETH
That keep the word of promise to our ear,	MACBETH
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.	MACBETH
Then yield thee, coward,	MACDUFF
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:	MACDUFF
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,	MACDUFF
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,	MACDUFF
'Here may you see the tyrant.'	MACDUFF
I will not yield,	MACBETH
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,	MACBETH
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.	MACBETH
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,	MACBETH
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,	MACBETH
Yet I will try the last. Before my body	MACBETH
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,	MACBETH
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'	MACBETH
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.	MALCOLM
Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,	SIWARD
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.	SIWARD
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	MALCOLM
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:	ROSS
He only lived but till he was a man;	ROSS
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd	ROSS
In the unshrinking station where he fought,	ROSS
But like a man he died.	ROSS
Then he is dead?	SIWARD
Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow	ROSS
Must not be measured by his worth, for then	ROSS
It hath no end.	ROSS
Had he his hurts before?	SIWARD
Ay, on the front.	ROSS
Why then, God's soldier be he!	SIWARD
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,	SIWARD
I would not wish them to a fairer death:	SIWARD
And so, his knell is knoll'd.	SIWARD
He's worth more sorrow,	MALCOLM
And that I'll spend for him.	MALCOLM
He's worth no more	SIWARD
They say he parted well, and paid his score:	SIWARD
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.	SIWARD
Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands	MACDUFF
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:	MACDUFF
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,	MACDUFF
That speak my salutation in their minds;	MACDUFF
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:	MACDUFF
Hail, King of Scotland!	MACDUFF
Hail, King of Scotland!	ALL
We shall not spend a large expense of time	MALCOLM
Before we reckon with your several loves,	MALCOLM
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,	MALCOLM
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland	MALCOLM
In such an honour named. What's more to do,	MALCOLM
Which would be planted newly with the time,	MALCOLM
As calling home our exiled friends abroad	MALCOLM
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;	MALCOLM
Producing forth the cruel ministers	MALCOLM
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,	MALCOLM
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands	MALCOLM
Took off her life; this, and what needful else	MALCOLM
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,	MALCOLM
We will perform in measure, time and place:	MALCOLM
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,	MALCOLM
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.	MALCOLM
